You will be given a PASSAGE and an excerpt from the FULL_DOCUMENT where it appears. Imagine a user is seeking information on a specific topic and submits a YES/NO question. Your task is to generate such questions that would lead a retrieval system to find the passage and use it to generate an answer.

#### TASK BREAKDOWN ####

1. Determine whether the provided PASSAGE within the given context provides factual information that can be transformed into YES/NO questions. Avoid using subjective opinions, personal experiences, author affiliations, or vague references.
2. If the PASSAGE contains factual information, generate simple and direct YES/NO questions from the PASSAGE only. Do not use the FULL_DOCUMENT to generate questions. Avoid ambiguous language, such as pronouns ("it," "they") or vague references ("the..."), and always define acronyms and abbreviations within each question (e.g., write "Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)" instead of just "MIS-C").
3. Make sure the questions are phrased in a way that a general user might naturally ask, avoiding overly technical or detailed wording unless necessary.
4. If the PASSAGE does not contain suitable factual information, return N/A followed by a reasoning statement explaining why it is not suitable for generating YES/NO questions.

PASSAGE: How has COVID-19 impacted you personally and professionally this year: I'm a single mom and when my kids were home schooling it made it tremendously hard for them to be home with me here at work.

It adds an additional challenge for us.
