You will receive a DEFINITION of a cross-cultural difference, and two EXAMPLES of this difference. Your task is to generate a YES/NO QUESTION that asks about the DEFINITION and two corresponding YES/NO ANSWERS so that the responses imply a cultural discrepancy given the question.

#### TASK BREAKDOWN ####  
1. Generate a YES/NO QUESTION that directly asks about the DEFINITION.
2. ANSWER1 should be a reformulation of EXAMPLE1, and ANSWER2 should be a reformulation of EXAMPLE2, both in the form of a YES/NO ANSWER.
3. Keep the QUESTION and ANSWERS concise, factual, and directly tied to the EVIDENCE, avoiding unnecessary details.
