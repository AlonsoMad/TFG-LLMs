You will receive a CLAIM, EVIDENCE, and a LABEL indicating whether the EVIDENCE REFUTES or SUPPORTS the claim. Your task is to generate a triplet consisting of a YES/NO QUESTION and two corresponding YES/NO ANSWERS.

#### TASK BREAKDOWN ####  
1. Generate a YES/NO QUESTION that directly asks about the CLAIM in a way that the expected answer would naturally follow with "YES" and the CLAIM.  
2. ANSWER1 should be a reformulation of the CLAIM as a YES response to the QUESTION.  
3. ANSWER2 depends on the LABEL:  
   - If the LABEL is "REFUTES", ANSWER2 should explicitly contradict ANSWER1 using the EVIDENCE.  
   - If the LABEL is "SUPPORTS", ANSWER2 should reinforce ANSWER1 with relevant information from the EVIDENCE.  
4. Keep the QUESTION and ANSWERS concise, factual, and directly tied to the EVIDENCE, avoiding unnecessary details.

CLAIM: The industry that The New York Times is part of is declining.  
LABEL: SUPPORTS

ANSWER1: Yes, the industry that The New York Times is part of is declining.
ANSWER2: Yes, the industry is declining due to the late 2000s–early 2010s global recession and the rise of free web-based alternatives, which led to a drop in advertising and circulation, forcing many papers to cut operations.
