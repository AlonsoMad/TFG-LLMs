The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea. This is also in contrast to toxins that cause watery diarrhea, which usually do not cause cellular damage, but rather they take over cellular machinery for a portion of life of the cell."

Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985."

At his 1825 inauguration, John Quincy Adams called the U.S. Constitution \"the work of our forefathers\" and expressed his gratitude to \"founders of the Union\". In July of the following year, this second President Adams, in an executive order upon the deaths of his father, John, and Jefferson, who both died on the same day, paid tribute to them as \"Fathers\" and \"Founders of the Republic\". These terms were used in the U.S. throughout the 19th century, from the inaugurations of Martin Van Buren and James Polk in 1837 and 1845, to Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech in 1860 and his Gettysburg Address in 1863, and up to William McKinley's first inauguration in 1897."

Jackson opposed the treaty in those terms He wanted to see the Creeks totally destroyed. During that time, Jackson was promoted to the rank of Major General and given control of the Seventh Military District. This ascension replaced the former Major General, Thomas Flournoy Jackson, now commander general, immediately destroyed the treaty of Pinckney and imposed severe terms on his enemies North Creek and the Southern Creeks and took 22 million acres (89,030 km2) of Creek land in what are now the states of Georgia and Alabama.[22] Jackson also took land from Indians who had been on the side of the Americans. Jackson said the terms should be accepted or the tribes would be expelled to Florida On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elders signed the Fort Jackson Treaty Even so, the warring factions of the Creek nation and the British never formally accepted the treaty.[22]"

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness."

While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985."

At his 1825 inauguration, John Quincy Adams called the U.S. Constitution \"the work of our forefathers\" and expressed his gratitude to \"founders of the Union\". In July of the following year, this second President Adams, in an executive order upon the deaths of his father, John, and Jefferson, who both died on the same day, paid tribute to them as \"Fathers\" and \"Founders of the Republic\". These terms were used in the U.S. throughout the 19th century, from the inaugurations of Martin Van Buren and James Polk in 1837 and 1845, to Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech in 1860 and his Gettysburg Address in 1863, and up to William McKinley's first inauguration in 1897."

Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native Americans. His political philosophy became the basis for the Democratic Party."

Jackson opposed the treaty in those terms He wanted to see the Creeks totally destroyed. During that time, Jackson was promoted to the rank of Major General and given control of the Seventh Military District. This ascension replaced the former Major General, Thomas Flournoy Jackson, now commander general, immediately destroyed the treaty of Pinckney and imposed severe terms on his enemies North Creek and the Southern Creeks and took 22 million acres (89,030 km2) of Creek land in what are now the states of Georgia and Alabama.[22] Jackson also took land from Indians who had been on the side of the Americans. Jackson said the terms should be accepted or the tribes would be expelled to Florida On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elders signed the Fort Jackson Treaty Even so, the warring factions of the Creek nation and the British never formally accepted the treaty.[22]"

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness."
