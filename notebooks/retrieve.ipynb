         "George Washington Born in the Colony of Virginia, Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States.",

As the first U.S. president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his cabinet between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Jay Treaty with Britain. Washington set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title \"Mr. President\", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Washington wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of tobacco and wheat at Mount Vernon, Washington owned many slaves. He began opposing slavery near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the manumission of his slaves.",

He learned mathematics and land surveying, and became a talented draftsman and mapmaker.

They were reinforced by an independent company of a hundred South Carolinians led by Captain James Mackay; his royal commission outranked Washington's and a conflict of command ensued. On July 3, 900 French soldiers attacked Fort Necessity, and the ensuing battle ended in Washington's surrender. Washington did not speak French, but signed a surrender document in which he unwittingly took responsibility for \"assassinating\" Jumonville, later blaming the translator for not properly translating it.

On Washington's recommendation, Braddock split the army into one main column and a smaller \"flying column\". Washington was suffering from severe dysentery so did not initially travel with the expedition forces. When he rejoined Braddock at Monongahela, still very ill, the French and their Indian allies ambushed the divided army. Two-thirds of the British force became casualties in the ensuing Battle of the Monongahela, and Braddock was killed. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage, Washington rallied the survivors and formed a rear guard, allowing the remnants of the force to retreat. During the engagement, Washington had two horses shot out from under him, and his hat and coat were pierced by bullets. His conduct redeemed his reputation among critics of his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity, but he was not included by the succeeding commander (Colonel Thomas Dunbar) in planning subsequent operations.",

Early in his legislative career, Washington rarely spoke at or even attended legislative sessions, but was more politically active starting in the 1760s, becoming a prominent critic of Britain's taxation and mercantilist policies towards the American colonies. Washington imported luxury goods from England, paying for them by exporting tobacco. His profligate spending combined with low tobacco prices left him £1,800 in debt by 1764. Washington's complete reliance on London tobacco buyer and merchant Robert Cary also threatened his economic security. Between 1764 and 1766, he sought to diversify his holdings: he changed Mount Vernon's primary cash crop from tobacco to wheat and expanded operations to include flour milling and hemp farming. Washington's stepdaughter Patsy suffered from epileptic attacks, and she died at Mount Vernon in 1773, allowing Washington to use part of the inheritance from her estate to settle his debts.",

Washington would not fight the British in a major engagement again for more than three years\".

In 1779, Arnold began supplying the British spymaster John André with sensitive information intended to allow the British to capture West Point, a key American defensive position on the Hudson River. On September 21, Arnold gave André plans to take over the garrison. André was captured by militia who discovered the plans, after which Arnold escaped to New York. On being told about Arnold's treason, Washington recalled the commanders positioned under Arnold at key points around the fort to prevent any complicity.

Washington was in command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continental troops. Inexperienced in siege warfare, he often deferred to the judgment of Rochambeau.

Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations and lowered nitric oxide (NO) levels have been detected in experimental and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage. We investigated whether a similar extracellular composition renders the brain more susceptible to CSDs. Electrophysiologic and blood flow changes were studied in vivo in rats. Intrinsic optical signals, alterations of NO level, and electrophysiologic changes were investigated in rodent and human brain slices. Elevation of subarachnoid extracellular potassium in rats in vivo triggered CSDs. Using NO-sensitive dyes, we found that CSDs induce NO synthesis in neurons and endothelial cells. When we blocked NO synthesis in vivo, CSDs occurred at a significantly lower threshold and propagated with a wave of ischemia. This increased susceptibility for CSDs by a low NO level was confirmed in rat and human neocortical slices and depended on P/Q-type calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but not on guanylate cyclase. Mice deficient in endothelial NO synthase, in contrast to mice deficient in neuronal NO synthase, had an inherently lower threshold.",

         "Nutrition studies in patients admitted to hospital frequently disregard oral intake because measurement is time-intensive and logistically challenging. In free-living populations, weighed food records (WFR) are the gold-standard and are conducted on weekend and weekdays to capture variations in intake, although this may not translate during hospitalisation. The present study aimed to determine whether oral intake differs between weekends and weekdays in hospitalised patients. For adult patients initially admitted to the intensive therapy unit with a moderate-severe head injury over a 12-month period, WFR were conducted each week on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday throughout hospitalisation. Meal components were weighed before and after consumption, and energy and protein intakes were calculated using specialised software. Data are reported as the mean (SD). Differences were assessed using paired t-tests and agreement using Bland-Altman plots. Thirty-two patients had WFR collected on 220 days, 68% (n = 149) on weekdays and 32% (n = 71) on weekends. Overall, daily intakes were 5.72 (3.67) MJ [1367 (877) kcal] and 62 (40) g protein. There were no differences in intake across all days (P = 0.937 energy, P = 0.797 protein), nor between weekdays and weekends, in weeks 1-3 of oral intake (all P > 0.1). Limits of agreement between mean intakes across days were wide for energy [range -11.20 to 9.55 MJ (-2680 to 2283 kcal)] and protein (range -125 to 110 g).",

We determined whether treatment with Mycobacterium vaccae by gavage influences the host immune response both locally and systemically.

A single intragastric administration of M. vaccae induced a transient increase in the production of IL-10 and IFN-gamma by mesenteric lymph nodes cells and splenocytes. In addition, in a mouse model of pulmonary allergic inflammation, a single treatment with M. vaccae by gavage not only diminished the total cellular infiltrate and the eosinophilic component induced by subsequent intratracheal allergen challenge, but also biased local and systemic cytokine production towards IL-10.

The authors reported previously that halothane protects against hypoxic and ischemia reperfusion injury in isolated hearts. The aim of this isolated heart study was to compare protective effects of halothane and low CaCl2 (0.5 mM) administered during 1 day of hypothermic perfusion on return of normothermic perfusion. Guinea pig hearts (n = 66) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with a Krebs' solution, gassed with 96% O2, 4% CO2, and containing 2.5 mM Ca2+, and 4.5 mM K+. Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Halothane was administered, or CaCl2 was decreased 0.5 h before hypothermia at 3.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C, during hypothermia for 22 h, and for 0.5 h after rewarming to 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Hearts were perfused at 25% of initial coronary flow during hypothermia. All groups had similar ventricular function and vasodilator responses before hypothermia. During normothermic reperfusion after hypothermia, both concentrations of halothane protected better than low CaCl2. Values, expressed as a percent of initial values in the five groups (time control, 3% halothane, 1.5% halothane, cold control, and 0.5 mM CaCl2, were respectively: 90 +/- 6, 54 +/- 6*, 48 +/- 5*, 27 +/- 8, 27 +/- 4% for left ventricular pressure; 84 +/- 5, 61 +/- 4*, 62 +/- 6*, 40 +/- 5, 34 +/- 5% for EFF; and 102 +/- 3, 63 +/- 3*, 66 +/- 3*, 55 +/- 2, 42 +/- 2% for coronary flow (*P < 0.05 halothane vs. 0.5 mM CaCl2).

Expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, associated with proliferation, apoptosis or both of gastrointestinal cancer cells, is mediated through MAP kinase families. However, the correlation between respective MAP kinase signals and COX-2 in the proliferation of gastric and colon cancer cells has not been well elucidated. We examined the effect of selective inhibitors of MAP kinases and COX-2 on serum-induced proliferation of gastric (MKN45) and colon (HT29) cancer cells. After 24-h serum starvation, cancer cells were stimulated with 2% serum and COX-2 inhibitors (NS398 10 micromol/L, or etodolac 100 micromol/L) or 1 h after preincubation with inhibitors for ERK (PD98059 20 micromol/L) or p38 MAPK (SB203580 10 micromol/L). Phosphorylated MAP kinases and COX-2 protein were evaluated by Western blotting, and the proliferation of cancer cells was estimated by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB and CREB were assayed by an electorophoretic mobility shift assay. Serum increased the proliferation of MKN45 and HT29 cells by 280% and 200%, respectively, compared with the control levels (100%). In both cancer cells, phosphorylated MAP kinases were increased within 30 min after stimulation.

Although AsA metabolism has been characterized in detail, the genetic mechanisms controlling AsA accumulation in tomatoes are poorly understood. The transcriptional control of AsA levels in fruits can be investigated by combining the advanced genetic and genomic resources currently available for tomato. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of fruit tissues was carried out on an introgression line containing a QTL promoting AsA accumulation in the fruit, using a parental cultivar with lower AsA levels as a reference. Introgression line IL 12-4 (S. pennellii in a S. lycopersicum background) was selected for transcriptomic analysis because it maintained differences in AsA levels compared to the parental genotypes M82 and S. pennellii over three consecutive trials. Comparative microarray analysis of IL 12-4 and M82 fruits over a 2-year period allowed 253 differentially-expressed genes to be identified, suggesting that AsA accumulation in IL 12-4 may be caused by a combination of increased metabolic flux and reduced utilization of AsA. In particular, the upregulation of a pectinesterase and two polygalacturonases suggests that AsA accumulation in IL12-4 fruit is mainly achieved by increasing flux through the L-galactonic acid pathway, which is driven by pectin degradation and may be triggered by ethylene.",

Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians. We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14°C and 36°C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20°C, 24°C, and 28°C) and four levels of thermal variation (0°C, 6°C, 13°C, and 20°C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures.

         "Air travel may pose risks to ex-preterm neonates due to the low oxygen environment encountered during flights. We aimed to study the utility of the preflight hypoxia challenge test (HCT) to detect in-flight hypoxia in such infants. Ex-preterm (gestation < or = 35 completed weeks) infants ready for air transfer from the intensive/special care nursery to regional hospitals were studied. A pretransfer HCT was performed by exposing infants to 14% oxygen for 20 min. Failure was defined as a sustained fall in pulse oxygen saturation (Spo(2)) < or = 85%. A nurse blinded to the test result monitored the in-flight oxygen saturations in each infant. If Spo(2) fell to < or = 85%, oxygen was administered. Forty-six infants with median gestation of 32.2 weeks (range, 24 to 35.6 weeks) and birth weight of 1,667 g (range, 655 to 2,815 g) were recruited.

Thirty-five infants (76%) passed the test, and the remainder failed. During the flight, 16 infants met the criteria for in-flight oxygen, but 12 of these infants (75%) had passed the preflight HCT.

         "Air travel may pose risks to ex-preterm neonates due to the low oxygen environment encountered during flights. We aimed to study the utility of the preflight hypoxia challenge test (HCT) to detect in-flight hypoxia in such infants. Ex-preterm (gestation < or = 35 completed weeks) infants ready for air transfer from the intensive/special care nursery to regional hospitals were studied. A pretransfer HCT was performed by exposing infants to 14% oxygen for 20 min. Failure was defined as a sustained fall in pulse oxygen saturation (Spo(2)) < or = 85%. A nurse blinded to the test result monitored the in-flight oxygen saturations in each infant. If Spo(2) fell to < or = 85%, oxygen was administered. Forty-six infants with median gestation of 32.2 weeks (range, 24 to 35.6 weeks) and birth weight of 1,667 g (range, 655 to 2,815 g) were recruited. No infants were receiving supplemental oxygen at the time of transfer. The HCT was performed at a median corrected age of 35.8 weeks (range, 33.1 to 43 weeks). Thirty-five infants (76%) passed the test, and the remainder failed. During the flight, 16 infants met the criteria for in-flight oxygen, but 12 of these infants (75%) had passed the preflight HCT.

         "Our previous studies revealed upregulation of stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) in cardiac vessels in dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the functional significance of STC1 is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of STC1 on TNF-alpha-induced monolayer permeability of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Cells were pretreated with STC1 for 30 minutes followed by treatment with TNF-alpha (2 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Monolayer permeability was studied using a transwell system. STC1 pretreatment significantly blocked TNF-alpha-induced monolayer permeability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. STC1 effectively blocked TNF-alpha-induced downregulation of endothelial tight junction proteins zonula occluden-1 and claudin-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. STC1 also significantly decreased TNF-alpha-induced superoxide anion production. The inhibitory effect of STC1 was specific to TNF-alpha, as it failed to inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial permeability. Furthermore, STC1 partially blocked NF-kappaB and JNK activation in TNF-alpha-treated endothelial cells. JNK inhibitor and antioxidant also effectively blocked TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and monolayer permeability in HCAECs.",

We analyzed retrospectively 431 patients liver transplanted between 1998 and 2008. PTLD was diagnosed in eleven of 431 patients (2.6%). PTLD, especially late PTLD, was significantly more frequent in patients who received steroids before LT (Kaplan-Meier: p<0.001). Moreover PTLD in immunocompromised patients with preoperative steroid treatment occurred at a significantly younger age (49.5+/-4.7 years) compared to patients without steroids (60.6+/-5.1 years; p=0.006).

         "We investigated the association between physical activity and coronary vasodilation to nitroglycerin (NTG) in the ADVANCE (Atherosclerotic Disease, Vascular Function, and Genetic Epidemiology) cohort of older healthy subjects. Physical activity may exert its beneficial effects by augmenting coronary responsiveness to nitric oxide. The relationship between physical activity and coronary vasodilatory response to NTG, an exogenous nitric oxide donor, has not been studied in a community-based population with typical activity levels. In 212 older adults (ages 60 to 72 years) without cardiovascular disease, we measured the coronary vasodilatory response to NTG using magnetic resonance angiography and physical activity using the Stanford Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. The primary predictor measure was total physical activity (kcal/kg/day). The primary outcome measure was coronary vasodilatory response (percent increase of cross-sectional area post-NTG). Coronary vasodilation was 27.6% in more active subjects (>35 kcal/kg/day, e.g., 1 h of walking per day) compared to 18.9% in less active subjects (p=0.03). Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between coronary vasodilation and physical activity (p=0.003), with a slope (beta) of 1.2% per kcal/kg/day. This finding remained significant after adjustment for cardiac risk factors, coronary calcium, the use of vasoactive or statin medications, and analysis of physical activity by quintiles (p < 0.05). Coronary vasodilation was also associated with physical activity intensity (p = 0.03).",

MTT dose response curves, cell migration assay, cell invasion assay, as well as three types of cell adhesive assay were performed on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The mechanism of the compounds on inhibiting heterotypic cell adhesion were further explored by determining the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), αv-integrin, β1-integrin and β5-integrin by western blotting assay. In five tested alkaloids, only protopine exhibited anti-adhesive and anti-invasion effects in MDA-MB-231 cells, which contributed to the anti-metastasis effect of Corydalis yanhusuo.

Serum LRG levels were significantly elevated in patients with AOSD (128.8±40.8 ng/mL) compared to those in patients with RA and in controls (33.9±15.2 ng/mL, p<0.001 and 22.4±6.1 ng/mL, p<0.001, respectively). Patients with active AOSD had significantly higher LRG levels than those with inactive disease (141.4±31.3 ng/mL vs. 79.8±37.1 ng/mL, p=0.002). Serum LRG levels were positively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP; γ=0.387, p=0.015), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; γ=0.370, p=0.026), ferritin (γ=0.687, p<0.001) levels, and the modified Pouchot score (γ=0.756, p<0.001). Serum LRG levels decreased significantly after treatment in all six patients with active AOSD who had follow-up evaluations (p=0.007).

Because HO-1 induction has been suggested to protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, we examined the effect of CAPE in experimental models of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Neuroprotective effect of CAPE was investigated in rat organotypic midbrain slice cultures and in vivo, using a mouse model of dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by intranigral injection of LPS and intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons in slice cultures from IFN-γ/LPS-induced injury. The effect of CAPE was inhibited by zinc protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, and by neutralizing antibody against brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 prevented activation of NF-E2-related factor 2, attenuated increased expression of HO-1 and BDNF, and blocked the neuroprotective actions of CAPE. In the LPS-injected mouse model, daily intraperitoneal administration of CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons, up-regulated HO-1 and BDNF, and reduced the increase of activated microglia/macrophages. Neuroprotective effects of CAPE against LPS-induced injury was prevented by zinc protoporphyrin IX or anti-BDNF antibody. CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons and alleviated methamphetamine-induced rotational behaviour also in 6-hydroxydopamine hemiparkinsonian mice.",

Although genomic studies have successfully broadened our understanding in diseases such as cancer, they have not been widely used in asthma studies. To link gene expression patterns to clinical asthma phenotypes. We used a microarray platform to analyze bronchial airway epithelial cell gene expression in relation to the asthma biomarker fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in 155 subjects with asthma and healthy control subjects from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). We first identified a diverse set of 549 genes whose expression correlated with FeNO. We used k-means to cluster the patient samples according to the expression of these genes, identifying five asthma clusters/phenotypes with distinct clinical, physiological, cellular, and gene transcription characteristics-termed \"subject clusters\" (SCs). To then investigate differences in gene expression between SCs, a total of 1,384 genes were identified that highly differentiated the SCs at an unadjusted P value < 10(-6).

         "Although asthma is recognized as a heterogeneous disease associated with clinical phenotypes, the molecular basis of these phenotypes remains poorly understood. Although genomic studies have successfully broadened our understanding in diseases such as cancer, they have not been widely used in asthma studies. To link gene expression patterns to clinical asthma phenotypes. We used a microarray platform to analyze bronchial airway epithelial cell gene expression in relation to the asthma biomarker fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in 155 subjects with asthma and healthy control subjects from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). We first identified a diverse set of 549 genes whose expression correlated with FeNO. We used k-means to cluster the patient samples according to the expression of these genes, identifying five asthma clusters/phenotypes with distinct clinical, physiological, cellular, and gene transcription characteristics-termed \"subject clusters\" (SCs). To then investigate differences in gene expression between SCs, a total of 1,384 genes were identified that highly differentiated the SCs at an unadjusted P value < 10(-6). Hierarchical clustering of these 1,384 genes identified nine gene clusters or \"biclusters,\" whose coexpression suggested biological characteristics unique to each SC. Although genes related to type 2 inflammation were present, novel pathways, including those related to neuronal function, WNT pathways, and actin cytoskeleton, were noted.",

         "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a crucial regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Among the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by VEGF, activation of the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling axis has emerged as a critical mediator of angiogenic processes. We and others previously reported a novel role for the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) as an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, via interaction with calcineurin, in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells. However, the functional significance of the PMCA/calcineurin interaction in endothelial pathophysiology has not been addressed thus far. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we here demonstrate that the interaction between PMCA4 and calcineurin in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells leads to downregulation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and to a significant reduction in the subsequent expression of the NFAT-dependent, VEGF-activated, proangiogenic genes RCAN1.4 and Cox-2. PMCA4-dependent inhibition of calcineurin signaling translates into a reduction in endothelial cell motility and blood vessel formation that ultimately impairs in vivo angiogenesis by VEGF.",

We utilized young female transgenic (mRen2)27 (Ren2) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) littermates and fed a high-salt diet (4%) over 3 weeks. Compared to SD and Ren2 controls, female Ren2 rats fed a high-salt diet displayed increases in proteinuria, periarterial and interstitial fibrosis as well as ultrastructural evidence of basement membrane thickening, loss of mitochondrial elongation, mitochondrial fragmentation and attenuation of basilar canalicular infoldings. These findings occurred temporally with increases in transforming growth factor-β but not indices of oxidant stress.",

         "Recent clinical data have suggested that prolonged cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) contribute to the pathogenesis of delayed ischemic neurologic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations and lowered nitric oxide (NO) levels have been detected in experimental and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage. We investigated whether a similar extracellular composition renders the brain more susceptible to CSDs. Electrophysiologic and blood flow changes were studied in vivo in rats. Intrinsic optical signals, alterations of NO level, and electrophysiologic changes were investigated in rodent and human brain slices. Elevation of subarachnoid extracellular potassium in rats in vivo triggered CSDs. Using NO-sensitive dyes, we found that CSDs induce NO synthesis in neurons and endothelial cells. When we blocked NO synthesis in vivo, CSDs occurred at a significantly lower threshold and propagated with a wave of ischemia. This increased susceptibility for CSDs by a low NO level was confirmed in rat and human neocortical slices and depended on P/Q-type calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but not on guanylate cyclase.

         "Recent clinical data have suggested that prolonged cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) contribute to the pathogenesis of delayed ischemic neurologic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations and lowered nitric oxide (NO) levels have been detected in experimental and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage. We investigated whether a similar extracellular composition renders the brain more susceptible to CSDs. Electrophysiologic and blood flow changes were studied in vivo in rats. Intrinsic optical signals, alterations of NO level, and electrophysiologic changes were investigated in rodent and human brain slices. Elevation of subarachnoid extracellular potassium in rats in vivo triggered CSDs. Using NO-sensitive dyes, we found that CSDs induce NO synthesis in neurons and endothelial cells. When we blocked NO synthesis in vivo, CSDs occurred at a significantly lower threshold and propagated with a wave of ischemia. This increased susceptibility for CSDs by a low NO level was confirmed in rat and human neocortical slices and depended on P/Q-type calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but not on guanylate cyclase. Mice deficient in endothelial NO synthase, in contrast to mice deficient in neuronal NO synthase, had an inherently lower threshold.",

The aim of this isolated heart study was to compare protective effects of halothane and low CaCl2 (0.5 mM) administered during 1 day of hypothermic perfusion on return of normothermic perfusion. Guinea pig hearts (n = 66) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with a Krebs' solution, gassed with 96% O2, 4% CO2, and containing 2.5 mM Ca2+, and 4.5 mM K+. Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Halothane was administered, or CaCl2 was decreased 0.5 h before hypothermia at 3.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C, during hypothermia for 22 h, and for 0.5 h after rewarming to 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Hearts were perfused at 25% of initial coronary flow during hypothermia. All groups had similar ventricular function and vasodilator responses before hypothermia.

Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Halothane was administered, or CaCl2 was decreased 0.5 h before hypothermia at 3.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C, during hypothermia for 22 h, and for 0.5 h after rewarming to 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Hearts were perfused at 25% of initial coronary flow during hypothermia. All groups had similar ventricular function and vasodilator responses before hypothermia. During normothermic reperfusion after hypothermia, both concentrations of halothane protected better than low CaCl2. Values, expressed as a percent of initial values in the five groups (time control, 3% halothane, 1.5% halothane, cold control, and 0.5 mM CaCl2, were respectively: 90 +/- 6, 54 +/- 6*, 48 +/- 5*, 27 +/- 8, 27 +/- 4% for left ventricular pressure; 84 +/- 5, 61 +/- 4*, 62 +/- 6*, 40 +/- 5, 34 +/- 5% for EFF; and 102 +/- 3, 63 +/- 3*, 66 +/- 3*, 55 +/- 2, 42 +/- 2% for coronary flow (*P < 0.05 halothane vs. 0.5 mM CaCl2). The coronary flow response to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (nitroprusside) vasodilators was also greater after halothane than after 0.5 mM CaCl2.",

         "High levels of ascorbic acid (AsA) in tomato fruits provide health benefits for humans and also play an important role in several aspects of plant life. Although AsA metabolism has been characterized in detail, the genetic mechanisms controlling AsA accumulation in tomatoes are poorly understood. The transcriptional control of AsA levels in fruits can be investigated by combining the advanced genetic and genomic resources currently available for tomato. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of fruit tissues was carried out on an introgression line containing a QTL promoting AsA accumulation in the fruit, using a parental cultivar with lower AsA levels as a reference. Introgression line IL 12-4 (S. pennellii in a S. lycopersicum background) was selected for transcriptomic analysis because it maintained differences in AsA levels compared to the parental genotypes M82 and S. pennellii over three consecutive trials. Comparative microarray analysis of IL 12-4 and M82 fruits over a 2-year period allowed 253 differentially-expressed genes to be identified, suggesting that AsA accumulation in IL 12-4 may be caused by a combination of increased metabolic flux and reduced utilization of AsA. In particular, the upregulation of a pectinesterase and two polygalacturonases suggests that AsA accumulation in IL12-4 fruit is mainly achieved by increasing flux through the L-galactonic acid pathway, which is driven by pectin degradation and may be triggered by ethylene.",

The combination of rs17482078, rs10050860, and rs30187 results in the construction of 3 major haplotypes that are associated with SpA (the \"protective\" haplotype T/T/C, the \"neutral\" haplotype C/C/C, and the \"susceptibility\" haplotype C/C/T). The aim of the present study was to determine whether such haplotypes might affect endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP-1) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, protein level, and/or enzymatic activity in antigen-presenting cells, a type of cell that is potentially relevant to disease pathogenesis. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were generated in 2 cohorts (a discovery cohort and a replication cohort) comprising a total of 23 SpA patients and 44 healthy controls. Lymphoblastoid B cell lines were established from individuals who were homozygous for the risk, the neutral, or the protective ERAP1 haplotype, respectively. In those samples, we investigated the relationship between ERAP1 haplotypes and mRNA expression level. We also used Western blot analysis to measure the relative protein expression of ERAP-1 and a fluorogenic assay to measure its enzymatic activity. In monocyte-derived DCs, there was a strong association between ERAP1 haplotypes and the ERAP-1 mRNA expression level, with higher levels in subjects harboring the susceptibility haplotype (P = 0.001 and P = 5.6 × 10(-7) in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively). In lymphoblastoid B cell lines, we observed a significant correlation between haplotype risk score and ERAP1 transcript or protein level (P = 0.003, ρ = 0.92 for both). Enzymatic activity followed a similar trend both in monocyte-derived DCs and in lymphoblastoid B cell lines.",

Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians. We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14°C and 36°C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20°C, 24°C, and 28°C) and four levels of thermal variation (0°C, 6°C, 13°C, and 20°C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures. At an average temperature of 24°C, only the highest level of DTF affected differentiation and growth rates, but at both cooler and warmer average temperatures, moderate DTF was enough to slow developmental and tail growth rates.",

Ex-preterm (gestation < or = 35 completed weeks) infants ready for air transfer from the intensive/special care nursery to regional hospitals were studied. A pretransfer HCT was performed by exposing infants to 14% oxygen for 20 min. Failure was defined as a sustained fall in pulse oxygen saturation (Spo(2)) < or = 85%. A nurse blinded to the test result monitored the in-flight oxygen saturations in each infant. If Spo(2) fell to < or = 85%, oxygen was administered. Forty-six infants with median gestation of 32.2 weeks (range, 24 to 35.6 weeks) and birth weight of 1,667 g (range, 655 to 2,815 g) were recruited. No infants were receiving supplemental oxygen at the time of transfer. The HCT was performed at a median corrected age of 35.8 weeks (range, 33.1 to 43 weeks). Thirty-five infants (76%) passed the test, and the remainder failed. During the flight, 16 infants met the criteria for in-flight oxygen, but 12 of these infants (75%) had passed the preflight HCT. Of the 11 infants who failed the HCT, only 4 infants (36%) required in-flight oxygen. The HCT incorrectly predicted in-flight responses in 42% (19 of 46 infants).",

In livers treated with TLCA (10 micromol/l)+TUDCA (25 micromol/l), combined inhibition of cPKC by the cPKC-selective inhibitor Gö6976 (100 nmol/l) or the non-selective PKC inhibitor staurosporine (10 nmol/l) and of PKA by H89 (100 nmol/l) reduced bile flow by 36% (p<0.05) and 48% (p<0.01), and secretion of the Mrp2/Abcc2 substrate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, by 31% (p<0.05) and 41% (p<0.01), respectively; bile flow was unaffected in control livers or livers treated with TUDCA only or TLCA+taurocholic acid. Inhibition of cPKC or PKA alone did not affect the anticholestatic action of TUDCA. Hepatic cAMP levels and CREB phosphorylation as readout of PKA activity were unaffected by the bile acids tested, suggesting a permissive effect of PKA for the anticholestatic action of TUDCA. Rat and human hepatocellular Mrp2 were phosphorylated by phorbol ester pretreatment and recombinant cPKC alpha, nPKC epsilon, and PKA, respectively, in a staurosporine-sensitive manner.",

         "Visual Restorative function training aims to decrease visual field defect size after acquired brain damage. Some chronic stroke patients regain permission to drive a car after training. This points to a concomitant change in oculomotor behavior, because visual field enlargement is hardly ever large enough for legal driving. This study investigated vRFT-induced changes in oculomotor behavior, using a driving simulator. Driving performance and oculomotor behavior were measured before and after training in 6 hemianopia patients who had trained 65 hours with vRFT on a PC at home. Two patients showed negligible visual field enlargement (VFE) and four showed moderate to substantial VFE. Because less visual cortex is devoted to the processing of peripheral than central visual field the same VFE corresponds to less functional restoration of cortex when the defect is at high eccentricity. When this is taken into account, then precisely the two patients that showed the largest cortical gains made significantly more eye movements in the direction of their visual field defect after training.",

Resveratrol and curcumin are plant-derived substances with biological properties that may have immunomodulatory properties. This study investigated the effect of continuous administration of resveratrol and curcumin and the association of resveratrol and curcumin on the progression of experimental periodontitis in rats. Forty Wistar rats were assigned randomly to the following groups: group 1, experimental periodontitis + placebo (PL) (n = 10); group 2, experimental periodontitis + resveratrol (RSV) (n = 10); group 3, experimental periodontitis + curcumin (C) (n = 10); and group 4, experimental periodontitis + resveratrol + curcumin (COMBI) (n = 10). Periodontitis was induced in rats by tying a silk suture, as a ligature, around one of the first molars. Daily administration of the placebo solution, 10 mg/kg of resveratrol, 100 mg/kg of curcumin or 10 mg/kg of resveratrol plus 100 mg/kg of curcumin was carried out from day 0 to day 30. At the end of the relevant experimental periods, rats were killed and the specimens obtained were processed for morphometric analysis of bone loss. Gingival tissues surrounding the first molar were collected for quantification of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) using a Luminex/MAGPIX assay. Intergroup comparisons of the morphometric outcomes revealed higher bone-loss values in the PL group (p < 0.05) when compared with RSV, C and COMBI groups. There was no difference in bone-loss values among RSV, C and COMBI groups (p > 0.05). The immunoenzymatic assay of the gingival tissue showed a lower concentration of IL-1β in the COMBI group in comparison with the PL group (p < 0.05). Higher values of IL-4 were demonstrated in groups RSV, C and COMBI in comparison with the PL group (p < 0.05). Only RSV caused a reduction in the levels of IFN-γ (p < 0.05).

Meropenem and levofloxacin penetrations into epithelial lining fluid were 39.3% and 64.3%, respectively. Both monotherapies demonstrated good exposure responses. An innovative combination-therapy analytic approach demonstrated that the combination was statistically significantly synergistic (α = 2.475), as was shown in the hollow fiber infection model. Bacterial resistant to levofloxacin and meropenem was seen in the control arm. Levofloxacin monotherapy selected for resistance to itself. No resistant subpopulations were observed in any combination therapy arm.",

MTT dose response curves, cell migration assay, cell invasion assay, as well as three types of cell adhesive assay were performed on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The mechanism of the compounds on inhibiting heterotypic cell adhesion were further explored by determining the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), αv-integrin, β1-integrin and β5-integrin by western blotting assay. In five tested alkaloids, only protopine exhibited anti-adhesive and anti-invasion effects in MDA-MB-231 cells, which contributed to the anti-metastasis effect of Corydalis yanhusuo. The results showed that after treatment with protopine for 90 min, the expression of EGFR, ICAM-1, αv-integrin, β1-integrin and β5-integrin were remarkably reduced.",

All experiments were performed on fresh or overnight cultured human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) that were isolated from healthy donors. PBMCs were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation before being treated with Adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1 mmol/L), human α-defensin-5 (HD-5, 50 μg/mL), and/or nigericin (Nig, 30 μmol/L). For each experiment, the culture supernatants were collected separately from the cells. Cell lysates and supernatants were both subject to immunoprecipitation with anti-IL-1β antibodies followed by western blot analysis with anti-caspase-1 and anti-IL-1β antibodies. We found that pro-IL-1β was processed to mature IL-1β in LPS-activated fresh and overnight cultured human monocytes in response to ATP stimulation. In the presence of HD-5, this release of IL-1β, but not the processing of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β, was completely inhibited. Similarly, in the presence of HD-5, the release of IL-1β, but not the processing of IL-1β, was significantly inhibited from LPS-activated monocytes stimulated with Nig. Finally, we treated LPS-activated monocytes with ATP and Nig and collected the supernatants. We found that both ATP and Nig stimulation could activate and release cleaved caspase-1 from the monocytes. Interestingly, and contrary to IL-1β processing and release, caspase-1 cleavage and release was not blocked by HD-5. All images are representative of three independent experiments.",

In the LPS-injected mouse model, daily intraperitoneal administration of CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons, up-regulated HO-1 and BDNF, and reduced the increase of activated microglia/macrophages. Neuroprotective effects of CAPE against LPS-induced injury was prevented by zinc protoporphyrin IX or anti-BDNF antibody. CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons and alleviated methamphetamine-induced rotational behaviour also in 6-hydroxydopamine hemiparkinsonian mice.",

At present, there is no evidence for the effect of tamoxifen treatment in EPS patients. This study investigates the effect of treatment with tamoxifen on survival in EPS patients. This study is a retrospective analysis of survival in EPS patients as part of the Dutch multicentre EPS study in the period January 1996 to July 2007. Sixty-three patients with severe EPS were followed up until August 2008. Demographic, patient and PD-related variables of EPS patients were investigated. Patients treated with tamoxifen were compared to patients not treated with tamoxifen. Survival was analysed with multivariate Cox regression analysis. Twenty-four patients were treated with tamoxifen, and 39 were not treated with tamoxifen. The clinical and demographic characteristics were similar for the tamoxifen-treated and non-treated groups. The mortality rate was significantly lower in tamoxifen-treated patients compared to EPS patients not treated with tamoxifen (45.8% vs 74.4%, P=0.03). Survival in tamoxifen-treated patients, adjusted for calendar time, age, use of corticosteroids, presence of functioning transplantation, use of parental nutrition and centre influences was longer in comparison to not-treated patients (HR 0.39, P=0.056).",

Comparison of genome sequences strains representative of this phylogenetic diversity can help determine which traits allow this bacterium to be such a pathogen of so many different plant species and how the bacteria survive in many different habitats.

Despite relatively high genetic distances (calculated from average nucleotide identity) and many genomic rearrangements, more than 60% of the genes of the megaplasmid and 70% of those on the chromosome are syntenic. The three new genomic sequences revealed the presence of several previously unknown traits, probably acquired by horizontal transfers, within the genomes of R. solanacearum, including a type IV secretion system, a rhi-type anti-mitotic toxin and two small plasmids.

This study included 471 consecutive patients from a registry database who underwent elective ICA stent placement without cerebral protection for high-grade (greater than 70% stenosis of the ICA, according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) symptomatic (n = 147) or asymptomatic (n = 324) ICA stenosis. Contralateral carotid arteries were investigated with angiography. Patients with and patients without contralateral high-grade stenosis (70%-99% stenosis, according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) or occlusion were compared with respect to 30-day neurologic outcome by using the chi2 test and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Neurologic events were observed in 33 patients (7%) with 15 transient ischemic attacks, eight minor strokes, and 10 major strokes that led to death in two patients (combined stroke and death rate, 4%). Eighty-eight patients (19%) with contralateral high-grade ICA stenosis and 43 patients (9%) with contralateral ICA occlusion exhibited a similar rate of postintervention combined neurologic events (n = 9, 7%) compared with patients without contralateral high-grade ICA stenosis or occlusion (n = 24, 7%) (P =.94). No differences were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Combined stroke and death rates were also comparable between symptomatic (four of 131, 3%) and asymptomatic (14 of 340, 4%) patients (P =.59). Of all variables tested, multivariate analysis did not detect any predictor for peri- or postinterventional neurologic events.",

         "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a crucial regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Among the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by VEGF, activation of the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling axis has emerged as a critical mediator of angiogenic processes. We and others previously reported a novel role for the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) as an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, via interaction with calcineurin, in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells. However, the functional significance of the PMCA/calcineurin interaction in endothelial pathophysiology has not been addressed thus far. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we here demonstrate that the interaction between PMCA4 and calcineurin in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells leads to downregulation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and to a significant reduction in the subsequent expression of the NFAT-dependent, VEGF-activated, proangiogenic genes RCAN1.4 and Cox-2. PMCA4-dependent inhibition of calcineurin signaling translates into a reduction in endothelial cell motility and blood vessel formation that ultimately impairs in vivo angiogenesis by VEGF.",

Parasitic plants, which obtain some or all of their nutrition through an attachment to a host plant, are often a striking exception. Heterotrophy can lead to relaxed constraint on some plastid genes or even total gene loss. We sequenced plastid genomes of two species in the parasitic genus Cuscuta along with a non-parasitic relative, Ipomoea purpurea, to investigate changes in the plastid genome that may result from transition to the parasitic lifestyle. Aside from loss of all ndh genes, Cuscuta exaltata retains photosynthetic and photorespiratory genes that evolve under strong selective constraint. Cuscuta obtusiflora has incurred substantially more change to its plastid genome, including loss of all genes for the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase. Despite extensive change in gene content and greatly increased rate of overall nucleotide substitution, C. obtusiflora also retains all photosynthetic and photorespiratory genes with only one minor exception.",

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is known to regulate diabetes-induced kidney injury, and recent literature would suggest that gender differences exist in RAAS-dependent responses in the kidney. In this regard, these gender differences may be overcome by excessive salt intake. Thereby, we hypothesized that salt would promote proteinuria in transgenic female rats under conditions of excess tissue angiotensin (Ang) II and circulating aldosterone. We utilized young female transgenic (mRen2)27 (Ren2) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) littermates and fed a high-salt diet (4%) over 3 weeks. Compared to SD and Ren2 controls, female Ren2 rats fed a high-salt diet displayed increases in proteinuria, periarterial and interstitial fibrosis as well as ultrastructural evidence of basement membrane thickening, loss of mitochondrial elongation, mitochondrial fragmentation and attenuation of basilar canalicular infoldings. These findings occurred temporally with increases in transforming growth factor-β but not indices of oxidant stress.",

         "Recent clinical data have suggested that prolonged cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) contribute to the pathogenesis of delayed ischemic neurologic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations and lowered nitric oxide (NO) levels have been detected in experimental and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage. We investigated whether a similar extracellular composition renders the brain more susceptible to CSDs. Electrophysiologic and blood flow changes were studied in vivo in rats. Intrinsic optical signals, alterations of NO level, and electrophysiologic changes were investigated in rodent and human brain slices. Elevation of subarachnoid extracellular potassium in rats in vivo triggered CSDs. Using NO-sensitive dyes, we found that CSDs induce NO synthesis in neurons and endothelial cells. When we blocked NO synthesis in vivo, CSDs occurred at a significantly lower threshold and propagated with a wave of ischemia. This increased susceptibility for CSDs by a low NO level was confirmed in rat and human neocortical slices and depended on P/Q-type calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but not on guanylate cyclase. Mice deficient in endothelial NO synthase, in contrast to mice deficient in neuronal NO synthase, had an inherently lower threshold.",

Overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) were calculated. Of all 269 patients, a total number of 113 patients (42.4%) was restaged according to the new FIGO staging, mainly downstaged. In patients with negative nodes, tumor size was not predictive for OS (p = 0.475) and DSS (p = 0.915). Patients of old FIGO stage III and negative node status showed no difference in survival with the group mentioned above (OS p = 0.105 and DSS p = 0.743, respectively). An increasing number of positive lymph nodes (range 1-9) led to a decrease in survival in OS and DSS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.004 respectively).

Reduced slow inward Ca2+ current and sarcoplasmic reticular effects on intracellular Ca2+ are likely involved. The authors reported previously that halothane protects against hypoxic and ischemia reperfusion injury in isolated hearts. The aim of this isolated heart study was to compare protective effects of halothane and low CaCl2 (0.5 mM) administered during 1 day of hypothermic perfusion on return of normothermic perfusion. Guinea pig hearts (n = 66) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with a Krebs' solution, gassed with 96% O2, 4% CO2, and containing 2.5 mM Ca2+, and 4.5 mM K+. Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Halothane was administered, or CaCl2 was decreased 0.5 h before hypothermia at 3.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C, during hypothermia for 22 h, and for 0.5 h after rewarming to 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Hearts were perfused at 25% of initial coronary flow during hypothermia. All groups had similar ventricular function and vasodilator responses before hypothermia. During normothermic reperfusion after hypothermia, both concentrations of halothane protected better than low CaCl2. Values, expressed as a percent of initial values in the five groups (time control, 3% halothane, 1.5% halothane, cold control, and 0.5 mM CaCl2, were respectively: 90 +/- 6, 54 +/- 6*, 48 +/- 5*, 27 +/- 8, 27 +/- 4% for left ventricular pressure; 84 +/- 5, 61 +/- 4*, 62 +/- 6*, 40 +/- 5, 34 +/- 5% for EFF; and 102 +/- 3, 63 +/- 3*, 66 +/- 3*, 55 +/- 2, 42 +/- 2% for coronary flow (*P < 0.05 halothane vs. 0.5 mM CaCl2).

         "Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK),c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK) are important intermediates of the signal-transduction pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus. Expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, associated with proliferation, apoptosis or both of gastrointestinal cancer cells, is mediated through MAP kinase families. However, the correlation between respective MAP kinase signals and COX-2 in the proliferation of gastric and colon cancer cells has not been well elucidated. We examined the effect of selective inhibitors of MAP kinases and COX-2 on serum-induced proliferation of gastric (MKN45) and colon (HT29) cancer cells. After 24-h serum starvation, cancer cells were stimulated with 2% serum and COX-2 inhibitors (NS398 10 micromol/L, or etodolac 100 micromol/L) or 1 h after preincubation with inhibitors for ERK (PD98059 20 micromol/L) or p38 MAPK (SB203580 10 micromol/L). Phosphorylated MAP kinases and COX-2 protein were evaluated by Western blotting, and the proliferation of cancer cells was estimated by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB and CREB were assayed by an electorophoretic mobility shift assay. Serum increased the proliferation of MKN45 and HT29 cells by 280% and 200%, respectively, compared with the control levels (100%). In both cancer cells, phosphorylated MAP kinases were increased within 30 min after stimulation. PD98059 and SB203580 inhibited the serum-induced proliferation of MKN45 by 21% and 51% and of HT29 by 81% and 69%, respectively. NS398 and etodolac inhibited the proliferation of HT29 by 21% and 41%, respectively, but not that of MKN45.

Although AsA metabolism has been characterized in detail, the genetic mechanisms controlling AsA accumulation in tomatoes are poorly understood. The transcriptional control of AsA levels in fruits can be investigated by combining the advanced genetic and genomic resources currently available for tomato. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of fruit tissues was carried out on an introgression line containing a QTL promoting AsA accumulation in the fruit, using a parental cultivar with lower AsA levels as a reference. Introgression line IL 12-4 (S. pennellii in a S. lycopersicum background) was selected for transcriptomic analysis because it maintained differences in AsA levels compared to the parental genotypes M82 and S. pennellii over three consecutive trials. Comparative microarray analysis of IL 12-4 and M82 fruits over a 2-year period allowed 253 differentially-expressed genes to be identified, suggesting that AsA accumulation in IL 12-4 may be caused by a combination of increased metabolic flux and reduced utilization of AsA. In particular, the upregulation of a pectinesterase and two polygalacturonases suggests that AsA accumulation in IL12-4 fruit is mainly achieved by increasing flux through the L-galactonic acid pathway, which is driven by pectin degradation and may be triggered by ethylene.",

Although each test may enhance risk stratification, their comparative abilities to screen for underlying coronary stenoses in individual patients is less established. Forty-two patients who had a 16-slice coronary computed tomography angiogram (CTA) performed were invited to have CPA, IMT, and CRP measured. CPA was defined as the sum of all the cross-sectional areas of each plaque >1 mm in diameter found in all carotid vessels bilaterally. CCS and the number plus degree of stenotic coronary arteries were determined by CTA. The presence of clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as the existence of any stenosis > or =50%. CTA identified clinically significant CAD in 43% of the patients. CPA >0 was more sensitive (72%) and specific (58%) than a CCS >0 (58% and 55%) for identifying CAD. A \"clean\" carotid artery (CPA=0) provides a superior negative predictive value (74%) and likelihood ratio of a negative test (0.48) than all other studies, in particular versus a CCS=0 (65% and 0.72). The areas under the receiver-operator curves for CPA and CCS in relation to any CAD were similar (0.640 versus 0.675). Carotid IMT and CRP performed poorly compared with CPA and CCS. For detecting CAD in only the left main or left anterior descending artery, the negative predictive value and likelihood ratio of a negative test remained superior for CPA (87% and 0.33) compared with CCS (80% and 0.56). In our population with a prevalence of these coronary lesions of 30%, the post-test probability in any patient with a negative CPA result is reduced to 10%.",

CPA was defined as the sum of all the cross-sectional areas of each plaque >1 mm in diameter found in all carotid vessels bilaterally. CCS and the number plus degree of stenotic coronary arteries were determined by CTA. The presence of clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as the existence of any stenosis > or =50%. CTA identified clinically significant CAD in 43% of the patients. CPA >0 was more sensitive (72%) and specific (58%) than a CCS >0 (58% and 55%) for identifying CAD. A \"clean\" carotid artery (CPA=0) provides a superior negative predictive value (74%) and likelihood ratio of a negative test (0.48) than all other studies, in particular versus a CCS=0 (65% and 0.72). The areas under the receiver-operator curves for CPA and CCS in relation to any CAD were similar (0.640 versus 0.675). Carotid IMT and CRP performed poorly compared with CPA and CCS. For detecting CAD in only the left main or left anterior descending artery, the negative predictive value and likelihood ratio of a negative test remained superior for CPA (87% and 0.33) compared with CCS (80% and 0.56). In our population with a prevalence of these coronary lesions of 30%, the post-test probability in any patient with a negative CPA result is reduced to 10%.",

Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians. We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14°C and 36°C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20°C, 24°C, and 28°C) and four levels of thermal variation (0°C, 6°C, 13°C, and 20°C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures. At an average temperature of 24°C, only the highest level of DTF affected differentiation and growth rates, but at both cooler and warmer average temperatures, moderate DTF was enough to slow developmental and tail growth rates.",

         "Children with severe or persistent back pain and stiffness often have an underlying organic cause but there is a large differential diagnosis, examination may be difficult and the problem is relatively rare in general paediatric practice. These difficulties appeared to lead to delays in diagnosis and management of children with this problem. To provide an approach to the diagnosis and management children with severe or persistent back pain or stiffness based on our clinical experience and the literature. The case histories of 10 children with severe back pain seen by the authors over a 5-year period were reviewed. They were chosen as illustrative examples of the diagnostic and management problems and did not represent a systematic review of all cases seen by the authors over that time. Underlying causes included infection, inflammation, neoplasm, trauma and vascular malformation. Four of the children had spinal cord compression which required urgent decompression.

         "Children with severe or persistent back pain and stiffness often have an underlying organic cause but there is a large differential diagnosis, examination may be difficult and the problem is relatively rare in general paediatric practice. These difficulties appeared to lead to delays in diagnosis and management of children with this problem. To provide an approach to the diagnosis and management children with severe or persistent back pain or stiffness based on our clinical experience and the literature. The case histories of 10 children with severe back pain seen by the authors over a 5-year period were reviewed. They were chosen as illustrative examples of the diagnostic and management problems and did not represent a systematic review of all cases seen by the authors over that time. Underlying causes included infection, inflammation, neoplasm, trauma and vascular malformation. Four of the children had spinal cord compression which required urgent decompression. There was one child with a conversion disorder but three children with organic disease were initially felt to have a conversion disorder. Investigations generally proceeded relatively slowly and the problem was not regarded as a semi-urgent situation carrying the risk of permanent paraplegia.

Periodontitis was induced in rats by tying a silk suture, as a ligature, around one of the first molars. Daily administration of the placebo solution, 10 mg/kg of resveratrol, 100 mg/kg of curcumin or 10 mg/kg of resveratrol plus 100 mg/kg of curcumin was carried out from day 0 to day 30.

In 212 older adults (ages 60 to 72 years) without cardiovascular disease, we measured the coronary vasodilatory response to NTG using magnetic resonance angiography and physical activity using the Stanford Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. The primary predictor measure was total physical activity (kcal/kg/day). The primary outcome measure was coronary vasodilatory response (percent increase of cross-sectional area post-NTG). Coronary vasodilation was 27.6% in more active subjects (>35 kcal/kg/day, e.g., 1 h of walking per day) compared to 18.9% in less active subjects (p=0.03). Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between coronary vasodilation and physical activity (p=0.003), with a slope (beta) of 1.2% per kcal/kg/day. This finding remained significant after adjustment for cardiac risk factors, coronary calcium, the use of vasoactive or statin medications, and analysis of physical activity by quintiles (p < 0.05). Coronary vasodilation was also associated with physical activity intensity (p = 0.03).",

The primary predictor measure was total physical activity (kcal/kg/day). The primary outcome measure was coronary vasodilatory response (percent increase of cross-sectional area post-NTG). Coronary vasodilation was 27.6% in more active subjects (>35 kcal/kg/day, e.g., 1 h of walking per day) compared to 18.9% in less active subjects (p=0.03). Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between coronary vasodilation and physical activity (p=0.003), with a slope (beta) of 1.2% per kcal/kg/day. This finding remained significant after adjustment for cardiac risk factors, coronary calcium, the use of vasoactive or statin medications, and analysis of physical activity by quintiles (p < 0.05). Coronary vasodilation was also associated with physical activity intensity (p = 0.03).",

We enrolled 39 patients with AOSD, 47 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 39 controls. Forty-five serum samples from the patients with AOSD were assayed for LRG using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Comprehensive AOSD activity was determined by a modified Pouchot score. Serum LRG levels were significantly elevated in patients with AOSD (128.8±40.8 ng/mL) compared to those in patients with RA and in controls (33.9±15.2 ng/mL, p<0.001 and 22.4±6.1 ng/mL, p<0.001, respectively). Patients with active AOSD had significantly higher LRG levels than those with inactive disease (141.4±31.3 ng/mL vs. 79.8±37.1 ng/mL, p=0.002). Serum LRG levels were positively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP; γ=0.387, p=0.015), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; γ=0.370, p=0.026), ferritin (γ=0.687, p<0.001) levels, and the modified Pouchot score (γ=0.756, p<0.001).

         "Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a component of honey bee propolis that can induce expression of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Because HO-1 induction has been suggested to protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, we examined the effect of CAPE in experimental models of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Neuroprotective effect of CAPE was investigated in rat organotypic midbrain slice cultures and in vivo, using a mouse model of dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by intranigral injection of LPS and intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons in slice cultures from IFN-γ/LPS-induced injury. The effect of CAPE was inhibited by zinc protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, and by neutralizing antibody against brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 prevented activation of NF-E2-related factor 2, attenuated increased expression of HO-1 and BDNF, and blocked the neuroprotective actions of CAPE. In the LPS-injected mouse model, daily intraperitoneal administration of CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons, up-regulated HO-1 and BDNF, and reduced the increase of activated microglia/macrophages. Neuroprotective effects of CAPE against LPS-induced injury was prevented by zinc protoporphyrin IX or anti-BDNF antibody. CAPE protected dopaminergic neurons and alleviated methamphetamine-induced rotational behaviour also in 6-hydroxydopamine hemiparkinsonian mice.",

Comparison of genome sequences strains representative of this phylogenetic diversity can help determine which traits allow this bacterium to be such a pathogen of so many different plant species and how the bacteria survive in many different habitats.

Despite relatively high genetic distances (calculated from average nucleotide identity) and many genomic rearrangements, more than 60% of the genes of the megaplasmid and 70% of those on the chromosome are syntenic. The three new genomic sequences revealed the presence of several previously unknown traits, probably acquired by horizontal transfers, within the genomes of R. solanacearum, including a type IV secretion system, a rhi-type anti-mitotic toxin and two small plasmids.

We used k-means to cluster the patient samples according to the expression of these genes, identifying five asthma clusters/phenotypes with distinct clinical, physiological, cellular, and gene transcription characteristics-termed \"subject clusters\" (SCs). To then investigate differences in gene expression between SCs, a total of 1,384 genes were identified that highly differentiated the SCs at an unadjusted P value < 10(-6). Hierarchical clustering of these 1,384 genes identified nine gene clusters or \"biclusters,\" whose coexpression suggested biological characteristics unique to each SC. Although genes related to type 2 inflammation were present, novel pathways, including those related to neuronal function, WNT pathways, and actin cytoskeleton, were noted.",

         "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a crucial regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Among the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by VEGF, activation of the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling axis has emerged as a critical mediator of angiogenic processes. We and others previously reported a novel role for the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) as an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, via interaction with calcineurin, in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells. However, the functional significance of the PMCA/calcineurin interaction in endothelial pathophysiology has not been addressed thus far. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we here demonstrate that the interaction between PMCA4 and calcineurin in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells leads to downregulation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and to a significant reduction in the subsequent expression of the NFAT-dependent, VEGF-activated, proangiogenic genes RCAN1.4 and Cox-2. PMCA4-dependent inhibition of calcineurin signaling translates into a reduction in endothelial cell motility and blood vessel formation that ultimately impairs in vivo angiogenesis by VEGF.",

In this regard, these gender differences may be overcome by excessive salt intake. Thereby, we hypothesized that salt would promote proteinuria in transgenic female rats under conditions of excess tissue angiotensin (Ang) II and circulating aldosterone. We utilized young female transgenic (mRen2)27 (Ren2) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) littermates and fed a high-salt diet (4%) over 3 weeks. Compared to SD and Ren2 controls, female Ren2 rats fed a high-salt diet displayed increases in proteinuria, periarterial and interstitial fibrosis as well as ultrastructural evidence of basement membrane thickening, loss of mitochondrial elongation, mitochondrial fragmentation and attenuation of basilar canalicular infoldings. These findings occurred temporally with increases in transforming growth factor-β but not indices of oxidant stress.",

In PHIRE (Public Health Innovation and Research in Europe), we investigated the extent and character of public health research calls and programmes in European countries. Country respondents, identified through national member associations of the European Public Health Association completed a standardized recording instrument. Public health research was defined, and the call period limited to the latest full year (2010). Of the 30 countries included (EU 27 plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), there were reports for 25 countries A simple classification of the calls was developed. There were 75 calls and programmes included. Of these, 41 (55%) together were in France and the UK, and 34 in a further 14 countries, while 9 countries reported there were no calls or programmes opened in 2010. Calls were categorized across diseases, behaviours, determinants, services and methodologies. Some calls were broad, while others--particularly in the countries with several calls--were more detailed towards specific issues. Levels of funding varied markedly and were difficult to define. Where stated, in 32 responses, 19 calls were only open to national applicants and 13 from abroad."

Benchmarking is a valuable tool to identify areas for improvement. Prior work indicates that chronic care coordination is poor in the DHS, especially in comparison with care in Kaiser Permanente (KP), an integrated delivery system based in the United States. We investigated population rates of hospitalisation and readmission rates for ambulatory care sensitive, chronic medical conditions in the two systems. Using a historical cohort study design, age and gender adjusted population rates of hospitalisations for angina, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension, plus rates of 30-day readmission and mortality were investigated for all individuals aged 65+ in the DHS and KP. DHS had substantially higher rates of hospitalisations, readmissions, and mean lengths of stay per hospitalisation, than KP had. For example, the adjusted angina hospitalisation rates in 2007 for the DHS and KP respectively were 1.01/100 persons (95%CI: 0.98-1.03) vs. 0.11/100 persons (95%CI: 0.10-0.13/100 persons); 21.6% vs. 9.9% readmission within 30 days (OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.84-3.47); and mean length of stay was 2.52 vs. 1.80 hospital days.

The aim of the current paper is to provide an overview of the Danish population-based registers in public health and health-related research, and to discuss their strengths and limitations. Danish registers on somatic and psychiatric hospital contacts as well as care provided by general practitioners were reviewed. The availability of demographic, individual-level variables of relevance for health-related research was summarized. Since 1968, every person living in Denmark has a unique identifier. This identifier is listed in Danish registers enabling linkage of information from a range of registers on an individual level. The nationwide coverage of all patient contacts at somatic and psychiatric hospitals, consultations with general practitioners, purchases of prescribed medications, and a complete follow-up with respect to causes of death support public health studies surveying trends of prevalence and incidence. Historical data on psychiatric and somatic hospitalizations since 1969 and 1977, respectively, allow an in-depth assessment of the burden of disease and time trends. Demographic characteristics of individuals and family units, together with information on education, employment, income, place of residence and migration, are provided by social registers."

However, there is a lack of scientific knowledge about these patients and their morbidity. The aim was to characterize a population of these sickness absentees regarding prevalence of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses and possible associations with sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health characteristics. A cross-sectional study was made up of 635 sickness absentees below the age of 64, who the local Social Insurance Offices in Stockholm County, Sweden, referred to a special unit for multidisciplinary investigation. Data was obtained from questionnaires and medical records. The patients were examined by board certified specialists in psychiatry, orthopaedic surgery, and rehabilitation medicine. Relative risks were estimated by use of modified Poisson regression to assess the associations between characteristics and diagnose outcomes. About 80% of the patients had more than one diagnosis. The vast majority had a psychiatric diagnosis, and approximately 55% had that in combination with at least one somatic diagnosis. An increased risk for being given a psychiatric diagnosis was found for men and unemployed people. In addition, lack of social life and friends and self-reported mental health problems were associated with psychiatric diagnoses but also among those who were given somatic diagnoses in combination with psychiatric diagnoses. Increased risks for somatic diagnoses were found for women and for patients with a higher education."

A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 183 occupational health (OH) physicians and 183 OH nurses. Descriptive statistics and frequency tables were used to characterize the variables. The differences between nurses and physicians were determined with Pearson's chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests. Both nurses and physicians felt that physical, social, psychological and informational privacy was important in the OH setting. The duration of work experience did affect perceptions of privacy. One-third of respondents considered it good practice to take a full medical history from prospective employees as part of the pre-employment assessment. Over half of the OHPs found the currently valid requirements concerning patients' information privacy too strict in that they may in certain cases complicate the provision of care and treatment."

         "title Uppsala County in Sweden launched an eHealth patient portal in 2012, which allows patients to access their medical records over the Internet. However, the launch of the portal was critically debated in the media. The professionals were strongly skeptical, and one reason was possible negative effects on their work environment. This study hence investigates the assumptions and perspectives of physicians to understand their framing of the patient portal in relation to their work environment. The study uses the concept of technological frames to examine how physicians in different specialties make sense of the patient portal in relation to their work environment. A total of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians from different specialties. Interviews were transcribed and translated. A theoretically informed thematic analysis was performed. The thematic analysis revealed 4 main themes: work tool, process, workload, and control. Physicians perceive medical records as their work tool, written for communication within health care only. Considering effects on work environment, the physicians held a negative attitude and expected changes, which would affect their work processes in a negative way. Especially the fact that patients might read their test results before the physician was seen as possibly harmful for patients and as an interference with their established work practices. They expected the occurrence of misunderstandings and needs for additional explanations, which would consequently increase their workload. Other perceptions were that the portal would increase controlling and monitoring of physicians and increase or create a feeling of mistrust from patients. Regarding benefits for the patients, most of the physicians believe there is only little value in the patient portal and that patients would mostly be worried and misunderstand the information provided."

To describe different perceptions of rationing, in particular, what citizens themselves believe influences their acceptance of having to stand aside for others in a public health service. Qualitative interviews, analysed by phenomenography, describing perceptions by different categories. Purposeful sample of 14 Swedish citizens, based on demographic criteria and attitudes towards allocation in health care. Participants expressed high awareness of limitations in public resources and the necessity of rationing. Acceptance of rationing could increase or decrease, depending on one's (i) awareness that healthcare resources are limited, (ii) endorsement of universal health care, (iii) knowledge and acceptance of the principles guiding rationing and (iv) knowledge about alternatives to public health services."

Few data are available on myocardial lipid levels and cardiac performance in FAO deficiencies. The purpose of this animal study is to assess fasting-induced changes in cardiac morphology, function, and triglyceride (TG) storage as a consequence of FAO deficiency in a noninvasive fashion. MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were applied in vivo in long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice (n=8 per genotype). Fasting was used to increase the heart's dependency on FAO for maintenance of energy homeostasis. In vivo data were complemented with ex vivo measurements of myocardial lipids. Left ventricular (LV) mass was higher in LCAD KO mice compared with WT mice (P<0.05), indicating LV myocardial hypertrophy. Myocardial TG content was higher in LCAD KO mice at baseline (P<0.001) and further increased in fasted LCAD KO mice (P<0.05). Concomitantly, LV ejection fraction (P<0.01) and diastolic filling rate (P<0.01) decreased after fasting, whereas these functional parameters did not change in fasted WT mice. Myocardial ceramide content was higher in fasted LCAD KO mice compared with fasted WT mice (P<0.05)."

Eighteen fasting nondiabetic patients with IDCM (14 men, 4 women, aged 58.8+/-8.0 years, ejection fraction 33+/-8.8%) and 8 matched healthy controls underwent examination of myocardial perfusion and oxidative and FFA metabolism, before and after acute reduction of serum FFA concentrations by acipimox, an inhibitor of lipolysis. Metabolism was monitored by positron emission tomography and [15O]H2O, [11C]acetate, and [11C]palmitate. Left ventricular function and myocardial work were echocardiographically measured, and efficiency of forward work was calculated. Acipimox decreased myocardial FFA uptake by >80% in both groups. Rate-pressure product and myocardial perfusion remained unchanged, whereas stroke volume decreased similarly in both groups. In the healthy controls, reduced cardiac work was accompanied by decreased oxidative metabolism (from 0.071+/-0.019 to 0.055+/-0.016 min(-1), P<0.01).

To date, it has not been tested whether prevention of the metabolic switch that occurs during the development of cardiac hypertrophy has unequivocal benefits on cardiac function and energetics. Because malonyl CoA production via acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) inhibits the entry of long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, we hypothesized that mice with a cardiac-specific deletion of ACC2 (ACC2H-/-) would maintain cardiac FAO and improve function and energetics during the development of pressure-overload hypertrophy. ACC2 deletion led to a significant reduction in cardiac malonyl CoA levels. In isolated perfused heart experiments, left ventricular function and oxygen consumption were similar in ACC2H-/- mice despite an ≈60% increase in FAO compared with controls (CON). After 8 weeks of pressure overload via transverse aortic constriction (TAC), ACC2H-/- mice exhibited a substrate utilization profile similar to sham animals, whereas CON-TAC hearts had decreased FAO with increased glycolysis and anaplerosis. Myocardial energetics, assessed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cardiac function were maintained in ACC2H-/- after 8 weeks of TAC. Furthermore, ACC2H-/--TAC demonstrated an attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy with a significant reduction in fibrosis relative to CON-TAC."

Contribution of amino acid metabolic regulation in the disease remains understudied. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were performed in mouse failing heart induced by pressure overload. Suppression of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic gene expression along with concomitant tissue accumulation of branched-chain α-keto acids was identified as a significant signature of metabolic reprogramming in mouse failing hearts and validated to be shared in human cardiomyopathy hearts. Molecular and genetic evidence identified the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 as a key upstream regulator of the BCAA catabolic regulation in the heart. Studies using a genetic mouse model revealed that BCAA catabolic defect promoted heart failure associated with induced oxidative stress and metabolic disturbance in response to mechanical overload. Mechanistically, elevated branched-chain α-keto acids directly suppressed respiration and induced superoxide production in isolated mitochondria. Finally, pharmacological enhancement of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase activity significantly blunted cardiac dysfunction after pressure overload."

The temporal pattern of this alteration in FAO enzyme gene expression was characterized in a rat model of progressive LV hypertrophy (LVH) and HF [SHHF/Mcc-facp (SHHF) rat].

In contrast, the activity and steady-state levels of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes a rate-limiting step in FAO, were not significantly reduced until the HF stage, indicating additional control at the translational or post-translational levels in the hypertrophied but nonfailing ventricle."

         "title In heart failure, cardiac energy metabolism is compromised. The failing myocardium is characterized by reduced contents of both phosphorylated (phosphocreatine) and non-phosphorylated (free) creatine content as well as decreased energy reserve via creatine kinase (creatine kinase reaction velocity). These changes may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic feeding with high-dose dietary creatine prevents the derangement of energy metabolism and the development of left ventricular remodeling in a rat model of heart failure, i.e. post-myocardial infarction (MI). Rats were subjected to sham operation or left coronary artery ligation. Surviving rats were fed with 0% (untreated) or 3% creatine (related to weight of diet) for 8 weeks. Creatine feeding increased serum creatine levels significantly approximately 2-fold. Thereafter, hearts were isolated, perfused and left ventricular pressure-volume curves obtained. Steady state and dynamic (CK reaction velocity) high-energy phosphate metabolism was determined with 31P NMR spectroscopy. In both MI groups (treated n = 8, untreated n = 7), pressure-volume curves were shifted right- and downward compared to both sham groups (treated n = 5, untreated n = 7), i.e. creatine had no effect on left ventricular remodeling. Likewise, similar reductions of phosphocreatine, free creatine and creatine kinase reaction velocity (untreated sham 12.0 +/- 0.7 mmol/lxs; untreated MI 7.8 +/- 0.7*; treated sham 13.6 +/- 1.0; treated MI 7.2 +/- 1.1*; *p < 0.025 sham vs. MI) were found in both MI groups."

Under conditions associated with O(2) deficiency, PPAR-alpha modulates substrate switch (between FA and glucose) aimed at the adequate energy production to maintain basic cardiac function. Both, positive and negative effects of PPAR-alpha activation on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury have been reported. Moreover, the role of PPAR-mediated metabolic shifts in cardioprotective mechanisms of preconditioning (PC) is relatively less investigated. We explored the effects of PPAR-alpha upregulation mimicking a delayed \"second window\" of PC on I/R injury in the rat heart and potential downstream mechanisms involved. Pretreatment of rats with PPAR-alpha agonist WY-14643 (WY, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h prior to I/R reduced post-ischemic stunning, arrhythmias and the extent of lethal injury (infarct size) and apoptosis (caspase-3 expression) in isolated hearts exposed to 30-min global ischemia and 2-h reperfusion. Protection was associated with remarkably increased expression of PPAR-alpha target genes promoting FA utilization (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) and reduced expression of glucose transporter GLUT-4 responsible for glucose transport and metabolism. In addition, enhanced Akt phosphorylation and protein levels of eNOS, in conjunction with blunting of cardioprotection by NOS inhibitor L-NAME, were observed in the WY-treated hearts."

The mechanism whereby descending inhibitory neurons, including noradrenergic neurons, produce antinociceptive effect remains unclear.

Adult male Fischer (a strain in which nitrous oxide shows strong antinociceptive properties) and Lewis (a strain in which nitrous oxide lacks antinociceptive properties) rats were exposed to either air (control) or nitrous oxide. Frozen sections of the spinal cord were either stained for c-Fos or double-stained for c-Fos and glutamic acid decarboxylase (a rate-limiting enzyme for GABA synthesis) and analyzed by standard or confocal microscopy. In Fischer rats, 90 min of 75% N2O administration increased the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the spinal cord approximately threefold as compared with the control group. The c-Fos-positive cells induced by nitrous oxide were almost entirely colocalized with glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells. In contrast, exposure did not change the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the spinal cord in Lewis rats."

Subsequently, the RT-PCR experiments were carried out to verify the changes in iNOS mRNA. Following the injections of CFA, there were no significant changes in the level of the three NOS proteins at the immediate time points. However, there was a significant upregulation of iNOS mRNA and protein 3 days after CFA-induced inflammation. Neither nNOS nor eNOS showed significant changes in the protein level at any of the longer time points. Capsaicin injection in the masseter, which we recently reported to upregulate all three NOS at the immediate time points, did not result in significant changes at longer time points."

The evoked population spike (PS) was recorded from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells before, during, and after hypoxia. Control groups received nitrogen concentrations equal to nitrous oxide throughout the experiments. Biochemical measurements were made from dissected CA1 regions under experimental conditions that matched the electrophysiology studies. Recovery of the PS after hypoxia was 18 +/- 7% in slices treated with 50% nitrous oxide before and during 3.5 min of hypoxia; this compares with 41 +/- 9% (P < 0.05) in nitrogen-treated slices. Slices treated with nitrous oxide (95%) only during hypoxia (6 min) also demonstrated significantly less recovery of the PS than did slices treated with nitrogen. There was no significant difference in recovery if nitrous oxide was discontinued after the hypoxic period. Adenosine triphosphate concentrations after 3.5 min of hypoxia in slices treated with nitrous oxide decreased to the same extent as in nitrogen-treated slices (47% vs. 50%).

Brain sections including the hypothalamus were immunostained for both c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) and CRF and the percentage of CRF-positive neurons expressing c-Fos was determined. The functional consequences of changes in CRF were investigated by assessing the effect of intracerebroventricular administration of a CRF antagonist (alpha-helical CRF9-41, 20 microg/10 microl) on both activation of locus ceruleus noradrenergic neurons and the antinociception (with the tail-flick latency test) produced by nitrous oxide. Inhalation of nitrous oxide induced a dose-dependent increase in c-Fos expression in CRF-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.

In the retina, NO synthetase (NOS) is found in retinal amacrine and ganglion cells, and it is evident that NO is involved in encoding visual information. In the present study, therefore, NO donors were used to study the effect of exogenous NO on the high K(+)-evoked release of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) in the rat retina. Isolated rat retinal preparations were superfused with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution. In each experiment, stimulation for 10 min with 30 mM KCl was done twice. The amounts of ACh released by the first or second KCl stimulation were termed S1 and S2 respectively. Test agents were applied just before the second KCl stimulation. The effects of test agents were evaluated as S2 divided by S1. ACh was converted to hydrogen peroxide and electrochemically assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations and lowered nitric oxide (NO) levels have been detected in experimental and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The hippocampus is a brain region proposed to mediate adaptation to stress and antidepressant behavioral effects. Therefore, it could be involved in the antidepressant effects of NOS inhibitors. To test the hypothesis that nNOS inhibition in the dorsal hippocampus will induce antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming test (FST) in rats. Rats implanted with cannulas aimed at the dorsal hippocampus were submitted to 15 min of forced swimming (pretest). Immediately before or after pretest they received bilateral microinjections of the nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 50, 100, or 200 nmol/0.5 microl) or vehicle, alone or combined with L-arginine. Additional groups received SIN-1 (125 or 250 nmol/0.5 microl), a NO donor, either before or after the pretest. Twenty-four hours later, immobility time was registered for 5 min in the FST. 7-NI (100 nmol) significantly decreased immobility time when administered either before or after pretest. Pretreatment with L-arginine (100 nmol/0.5 microl) prevented these effects but produced no significant effects per se. SIN-1 did not induce any significant effect."

         "title The study hypothesizes that nitrous oxide (N(2)O) releases opioid peptide in the brain stem, which results in inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABAergic) neurons that tonically inhibit the descending noradrenergic inhibitory neurons (DNIN), resulting in activation of DNIN. In the spinal cord, activation of DNIN leads to the release of norepinephrine, which inhibits nociceptive processing through direct activation of alpha2 adrenoceptor and indirect activation of GABAergic neurons through alpha1 adrenoceptor. Arising from this hypothesis, it follows that GABAergic neurons will modulate the antinociceptive effect of N(2)O in diametrically opposite directions at supraspinal and spinal levels. The authors have tested this tenet and further examined the effect of midazolam, a GABA-mimetic agent, on N(2)O-induced antinociceptive effect. Adult male Fischer rats were administered muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) intracerebroventricularly (icv), gabazine (GABA(A) receptor antagonist) intrathecally (intrathecal), or midazolam intraperitoneally (intraperitoneal). Fifteen minutes later, they were exposed to air or 75% N(2)O and were subjected to the plantar test after 30 min of gas exposure. In some animals administered with midazolam, gas exposure was continued for 90 min, and the brain and spinal cord were examined immunohistochemically.

         "title To investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of cortical hyperexcitability and trigeminal nociceptive facilitation induced by serotonin (5-HT) depletion. Nitric oxide and 5-HT are important in the pathogenesis of primary headaches. An increase in cortical excitability and trigeminal nociception has been demonstrated in animals with low 5-HT levels. Although the mechanism underlying this increase is unclear, an alteration of the NO system is one possible explanation. Male Wistar rats were divided into control and 5-HT-depleted groups. 5-HT was depleted by i.p. injection of parachlorophenylalanine (100 mg/kg). Three days after injection, a microelectrode was inserted into the cerebral cortex for electrocorticograph recording and waves of cortical spreading depression (CSD) were triggered with KCl application. N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 mg/kg by i.v. injection) or saline was given after the second CSD wave. Following the experiment, the cerebral cortex and brain stem were removed for anti-neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and anti-Fos immunohistochemistry. Relative to the control group, the 5-HT-depleted group exhibited a higher frequency of CSD waves, more nNOS-immunoreactive cells in both the cerebral cortex and brainstem and more Fos-immunoreactive cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). In the control group, L-NAME application led to fewer nNOS-immunoreactive cells in the cerebral cortex and TNC, and fewer Fos-immunoreactive cells in the TNC; however, L-NAME was without effect on the CSD pattern. By contrast, in addition to decreased nNOS and Fos expression, L-NAME significantly reduced the frequency of CSD events in the 5-HT-depleted group."

This study investigated the role of nitric oxide in cochlear neurotransmission. In gerbils, cochlear compound action potential thresholds were recorded before and after cochlear perfusions with control solutions of artificial perilymph solution and test solutions of S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (MTC), a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Cochleas were also preperfused with L-arginine before perfusion with a mixture of MTC/L-arginine (to overcome competitive inhibition by MTC with L-arginine, the natural substrate of nitric oxide synthase). Cochlear perfusion with MTC caused significant elevations of compound action potential threshold of 51 dB as opposed to insignificant elevations of only 10 dB in control animals. An insignificant threshold shift of 9 dB was observed when L-arginine was coperfused with MTC."

These results confirm the association of the WNT16 gene with bone mass and osteoporotic fractures. Osteoporosis has a strong genetic component. Wnt ligands stimulate the differentiation of osteoblast precursors and play a major role in skeletal homeostasis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the association of allelic variants of the WNT16 gene with BMD, other structural parameters of bone and osteoporotic hip fractures. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms were analysed in 1,083 Caucasian individuals over 49 years of age. Two missense polymorphisms (rs2908004 and rs2707466) were associated with femoral neck BMD, with average differences across genotypes of 35 mg/cm(2) (p = 0.00037 and 0.0015, respectively).

We genotyped nine SNPs from the most promising aBMD candidates in a cohort of 15-yr-olds [in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)] and carried out association analysis with several tibial pQCT measures to determine whether these candidates were important during adolescent growth and which particular skeletal parameters each of the candidates were acting upon. We also carried out a metaanalysis of the SNPs for association with cortical bone mineral density (BMDC) in ALSPAC and a similar male-only study (Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants). In the ALSPAC cohort, we found a significant association between RANK SNP (rs3018362) and BMDC but not any of the other pQCT bone measures.

         "title Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms have been inconsistently associated with bone mineral density (BMD). To precisely evaluate the associations between three VDR gene polymorphisms and BMD, we performed a large-scale representative study of the Japanese female population. Fifty women were randomly selected from each of the 5-year age stratified populations (15-79 years) in each of the three municipalities examined, as a part of the Japanese population-based osteoporosis (JPOS) baseline study in 1996. In the study, BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and distal forearm were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Two polymorphisms were determined in the VDR gene locus identified by the restriction endonucleases ApaI and TaqI through a novel allele discrimination method using two different allele-specific fluorescence probes. The other VDR gene polymorphism was identified by the restriction endonuclease FokI using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Changes in BMD were determined in a follow-up study 3 years after the baseline study. After the exclusion of women who had any medical or menstrual history affecting BMD, 1434 women were analysed. The annual per cent changes in BMD at the lumbar spine over 3 years in subjects with tt genotype in the TaqI polymorphism were different from other genotypes, both in the women who were premenopausal at the follow-up survey (F-premenopausal women) and in the women who were postmenopausal at the baseline survey (B-postmenopausal women). However, the effects of tt genotype on change in BMD were opposite in the two groups. In addition, these associations or tendencies were not observed at the different skeletal sites."

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of this locus on other bone health outcomes; calcaneal ultrasound (QUS) parameters, radial peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) parameters and markers of bone turnover in a population sample of European men. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the 6q25 locus were genotyped in men aged 40-79 years from 7 European countries, participating in the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS). The associations between SNPs and measured bone parameters were tested under an additive genetic model adjusting for centre using linear regression. 2468 men, mean (SD) aged 59.9 (11.1) years had QUS measurements performed and bone turnover marker levels measured. A subset of 628 men had DXA and pQCT measurements. Multiple independent SNPs showed significant associations with BMD using all three measurement techniques. Most notably, rs1999805 was associated with a 0.10 SD (95%CI 0.05, 0.16; p = 0.0001) lower estimated BMD at the calcaneus, a 0.14 SD (95%CI 0.05, 0.24; p = 0.004) lower total hip BMD(a), a 0.12 SD (95%CI 0.02, 0.23; p = 0.026) lower lumbar spine BMD(a) and a 0.18 SD (95%CI 0.06, 0.29; p = 0.003) lower trabecular BMD at the distal radius for each copy of the minor allele. There was no association with serum levels of bone turnover markers and a single SNP which was associated with cortical density was also associated with cortical BMC and thickness."

To determine the association of BMP7 polymorphisms and BMD and osteoporotic fracture susceptibility, we performed a case-control association study in postmenopausal Chinese women with or without osteoporotic fracture. A total of 3815 unrelated postmenopausal Chinese women (1238 with osteoporotic fracture and 2577 healthy controls) were recruited. BMDs of the lumbar spine 1-4 (L1-4) and proximal femur (including total hip and femoral neck) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Eight tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BMP7 gene, including rs11086598, rs4811822, rs12481628, rs6025447, rs230205, rs17404303, rs162316 and rs6127980, were genotyped. Among the 8 SNPs, rs6025447 and rs230205 were associated with total hip BMD (P=0.013 and 0.045, respectively). However, the associations became statistically insignificant after adjusting for age, height and weight. The TGTG haplotype of BMP7 gene was associated with total hip BMD (P=0.032), even after adjusting for age, height and weight (P=0.048); but the association was insignificant after performing the Bonferroni multiple-significance-test correction. Moreover, the 8 SNPs and 9 haplotypes of BMP7 gene were not associated with L1-4 or femoral neck BMD or osteoporotic fracture."

         "title The phenotype of the vitamin D binding and macrophage activating protein, Gc, is a predictor of premenopausal bone fracture risk, possibly mediated through activation of osteoclasts. This was concluded from a study on 595 Danish perimenopausal women 45-58 years of age (30,040 person years). The multifunctional plasma protein Gc, also known as group-specific component, Gc globulin, or vitamin D binding protein (DBP), has two functions with relation to bone tissue: it is the major carrier protein of vitamin D in the circulation, and deglycosylation converts it into a very potent macrophage- and osteoclast-activating factor (Gc-MAF). There are several phenotypes of Gc, and in this study, we examined the relation between Gc phenotype and bone fragility. By isoelectric focusing we identified the Gc phenotype of 595 white recent postmenopausal women enrolled into the Danish Osteoporosis Prevention Study (DOPS) and identified three groups: Gc1-1 (n = 323), Gc1-2 (n = 230), and Gc2-2 (n = 42). Differences between the three groups were examined with respect to number of fractures before enrollment, BMC and BMD, and various biochemical and clinical parameters, including the concentration of Gc measured by immunonephelometry and the concentration of the macrophage marker soluble CD163 measured by ELISA."

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms explain only a small part of the genetic influence on the level of bone mineral density (BMD), whereas their effect on fracture remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between VDR genotypes and fracture risk. A prospective population-based cohort was studied. A total of 589 postmenopausal women (mean age, 62 yr) were followed prospectively during a median (interquartile) of 11 (1.1) yr. The study measured incidents of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. VDR allele B was significantly and dose dependently overrepresented in women who fractured, including 34 and 86 women with first incident vertebral and nonvertebral fragility fractures, respectively. This corresponded to an odds ratio of 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.95-2.40) for heterozygous carriers (bB, n = 286) and 2.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.79) for homozygous carriers (BB, n = 90) of the B allele, compared with women with the bb genotype (n = 213). VDR genotype groups did not differ for demographics, physical activity, grip strength, personal and maternal history of fracture, and calcium intake. The association was independent of BMD of the spine, hip, and radius, and of the BMD loss at the radius. The relationship between VDR polymorphisms and fracture risk was not altered after adjustment for baseline circulating levels of bone turnover markers, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, SHBG, IGF-I, intact PTH, and 25 hydroxyvitamin D."

LRP5 gene was previously shown to be involved in rare diseases affecting bone mass. Mutations associated with gain-of-function were described as well as loss-of-function mutations. Following this discovery, many frequent LRP5 polymorphisms were tested against the variation of BMD in the normal population. Heel bone parameters (SOS, BUA) were measured by right calcaneal QUS in 5021 healthy French-Canadian women and for 2104 women, BMD evaluated by DXA at two sites was available (femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS)). Among women with QUS measures and those with DXA measures, 26.5% and 32.8% respectively were premenopausal, 9.2% and 10.7% were perimenopausal and 64.2% and 56.5% were postmenopausal. About a third of the peri- and postmenopausal women never received hormone therapy. Two single nucleotide coding polymorphisms (Val667Met and Ala1330Val) in LRP5 gene were genotyped by allele-specific PCR. All bone measures were tested individually for associations with each polymorphism by analysis of covariance with adjustment for non genetic risk factors. Furthermore, haplotype analysis was performed to take into account the strong linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms."

         "title Correct staging is a cornerstone in cancer treatment. The FIGO surgical staging for endometrial cancer was revised in 2009. We have evaluated if the revision improved stratification with respect to prognosis in a large prospective multicenter setting. 1268 endometrial cancer patients have been prospectively recruited in the MoMaTEC study for the investigation of clinical and histopathological data. Restaging from FIGO 88 to FIGO 09 criteria increased the number of stage I cases from 932 to 979. The majority of the non-endometrioid tumors, down-staged to FIGO 09 stage I, were of serous histology. One third of the patients classified as stage II tumors based on FIGO 88 criteria (FIGO88 IIA) were down-staged to FIGO 09 IA (53%) and FIGO 09 IB (47%). The histological subtype for these cases was mainly endometrioid (86.1%) and high/intermediate grade (77.7%). Patients with FIGO 88 stages IA, IB, IIA and IIIA with positive cytology only, showed similar survival. In Cox multivariate survival analysis adjusting for histopathological variables we found that the revised FIGO 09 criteria improved prognostication. For FIGO stage I patients the adjusted HR was 3.9 (p=0.01, CI 1.35-11.36) for FIGO IB compared to FIGO IA. The independent prognostic impact for the FIGO 09 staging was also confirmed in a subset analysis of patients not subjected to lymphadenectomy and for the endometrioid subgroup."

Patients were restaged according to current FIGO 2009 guidelines. Primary endpoint was local control and secondary endpoints were distant recurrence and overall survival. The median age of the cohort was 67 years old with a mean follow up 152 months. Adjuvant radiation was delivered in 60 patients (48%). There were a total of 24 recurrences; 5 had local-regional recurrences, 4 local and distant recurrence, 12 distant only recurrences, and 3 had unspecified recurrences. The 5-year local-regional control was 97.8% in patients who received radiation and 80.1% in patients who did not receive radiation (p=0.018). The 5-year overall survival rate was 68.1% if patients did not receive radiation and 84.9% if they did receive radiation (p=0.0062). On univariate analysis, only radiation (HR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.49, p-value=0.018) was associated with a significant increase in local relapse free survival."

Single institution retrospective study of 467 patients with FIGO stage I and II endometrial cancer treated with primary surgery including lymph node dissection. Analysis included pelvic lymph node count, histology, stage, age, race, BMI, year of surgery, depth of myometrial invasion, and adjuvant radiation. Kaplan-Meier life-tables were used to calculate survival; the Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify prognostic factors independently associated with survival. Mean pelvic lymph node count was 12.6 (SD +/- 8). Distant recurrence was associated with decreased pelvic lymph node count, high-risk histology, and postoperative pelvic radiation. Pelvic lymph node count was not associated with survival by univariate analysis, however, overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival were significantly better with pelvic lymph node counts >or=12 among women with high-risk histology (P < 0.001), but not among women with low-risk histology. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified increasing age, non-Caucasian race, and high-risk histology as independent negative prognostic factors for both OS and PFI. Among patients with high-risk histology, pelvic lymph node count remained an independent prognostic factor for both overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in the model, with hazard ratios of 0.28 and 0.29, respectively, when >or=12 pelvic lymph nodes were identified.

Seventy-five patients with FIGO Stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix who were treated with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy between 1991 and 1996 were divided into two groups according to their COX-2 level in an immunohistochemical study: the COX-2 negative group (n = 54 patients) and the COX-2 positive group (n = 21 patients). The clinicopathologic features, patterns of treatment failure, and survival data for patients in the COX-2 positive group were compared with data from the patients in the COX-2 negative group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors that influenced patient survival. In the immunohistochemical study, COX-2 overexpression was observed in approximately 30% of patients with FIGO Stage IIB SCC of the uterine cervix. With delayed regression to the initial treatment, the treatment failure rate of patients in the COX-2 positive group was much higher compared with the treatment failure rate of patients in the COX-2 negative group. The higher incidence of central failure and lymph node failure for patients in the COX-2 positive group was statistically significant (48% for the COX-2 positive group vs. 13% for the COX-2 negative group). However, there was no difference in the incidence of hematogenous metastases between the two groups (5% for the COX-2 positive group vs. 7% for the COX-2 negative group). In addition, increased COX-2 expression in tumor cells also was correlated with a shorter interval to tumor recurrence (median interval to recurrence, 9 months in the COX-2 positive group vs. 26 months in the COX-2 negative group). Compared with patients in the COX-2 negative group, patients in the COX-2 positive group had lower overall actuarial and disease free survival rates (overall 5-year actuarial survival rates: 56% for the COX-2 positive group vs. 94% for the COX-2 negative group; P = 0.003). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that COX-2 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor that surpassed other well-known clinicopathologic parameters."

The relapse-free and overall survival rate was 61.4%. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the degree of lymphoreticular cells infiltrating the cervix, lymph node metastases, barrel shape of the cervix, lymph-vascular space invasion, more than three lymph nodes involved, and bulky tumor size (i.e. tumor size larger than 4 cm) were of prognostic significance in disease-free survival. However, pronounced lymphoreticular cells infiltrating the cervical cancer was the only independent factor to disease-free survival in patients with FIGO stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma treated with radical hysterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection using multivariate analysis."

         "title High grade histologies of endometrial carcinomas portend a worse prognosis. Previous randomized, prospective studies examining the role of radiation have excluded endometrial cancer patients with FIGO IB with high risk histologies (clear cell, papillary serous, and Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma). We retrospectively identified 51 patients who underwent a hysterectomy for a FIGO IB endometrial carcinoma with clear cell, papillary serous or Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma histology. Adjuvant radiation therapy was delivered in 44 of 51 patients (86%). We assessed pelvic control, vaginal control, and overall survival using Kaplan Meier estimate and the log rank test. We completed univariate analysis. The 5-year vaginal control rate in patients without and with adjuvant radiation therapy was 67% and 93.3%, respectively (p=0.0066). At 5-years, the pelvic control rate in patients without and with adjuvant radiation therapy was 0% and 81.5%, respectively (p=0.0003). At 5-years, the overall survival was 80% in patients who had adjuvant radiation compared to 21.4% in patients who did not have adjuvant radiation (p=0.0026). Radiation therapy was the only studied variable that was associated with pelvic control. Radiation therapy, advanced age and pelvic lymphadenectomy were associated with overall survival."

A retrospective study of 44 patients with FIGO stage II-IV endometrial carcinoma who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and, all except three, pelvic lymph node dissection. At operation, a peritoneal washing sample was taken for cytological examination. Flow cytometry was performed on fresh primary tumor samples. Blood samples were obtained within 2 weeks before surgery. The median follow-up time was 54 months. In univariate analysis, DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction, serum CA 125 level and peritoneal cytological findings correlated significantly with survival. In multivariate analysis, peritoneal cytology (benign versus malignant), grade (1 + 2 versus 3) and preoperative serum CA 125 concentration (< or = 25 U/ml versus > 25 U/ml) remained significant independent predictors of overall survival. DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction had a strong correlation with peritoneal cytology. Malignant cytological findings were more frequent in cases with DNA aneuploidy and S-phase fraction higher than 8%."

         "title In light of the recent changes in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, the objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of positive peritoneal cytology (PPC) among patients with early stage endometrial cancer. Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 1988 and 2005. Only those patients with stage I/II endometrial cancer who had undergone a complete staging procedure (lymph-node removal) were included. Statistical analyses used Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier log rank, and Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 14,704 patients were identified: 14,219 with negative peritoneal cytology (NPC) and 485 with positive peritoneal cytology. More patients with PPC compared to those with NPC were diagnosed with high-risk factors such grade III disease (40.2% vs. 23.8%, p<0.0001), and unfavorable histologic types such as clear cell/serous carcinoma (17.5% vs. 7.5%, p=<0.0001) and carcinosarcoma (9.3% vs. 5.6%, p<0.0001). When compared to patients with negative peritoneal cytology, survival was significantly worse among patients with positive peritoneal cytology (p<0.0001): 5-year disease specific survival 95.1% vs. 80.8% in endometrioid adenocarcinoma; 78.0% vs. 50.4% in clear cell/serous cancer; and 64.7% vs. 32.3% in carcinosarcoma. After adjusting for other contributing factors in the multivariable model, PPC remained an independent predictor of poor survival (p<0.0001) in all histologic types examined."

Interventions to prevent these errors at the point of prescribing have had limited success. The purpose of this study is to measure whether indication alerts at the time of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) can intercept drug name confusion errors. A retrospective observational study of alerts provided to prescribers in a public, tertiary hospital and ambulatory practice with medication orders placed using CPOE. Consecutive patients seen from April 2006 through February 2012 were eligible if a clinician received an indication alert during ordering. A total of 54,499 unique patients were included. The computerized decision support system prompted prescribers to enter indications when certain medications were ordered without a coded indication in the electronic problem list. Alerts required prescribers either to ignore them by clicking OK, to place a problem in the problem list, or to cancel the order. Main outcome was the proportion of indication alerts resulting in the interception of drug name confusion errors. Error interception was determined using an algorithm to identify instances in which an alert triggered, the initial medication order was not completed, and the same prescriber ordered a similar-sounding medication on the same patient within 5 minutes. Similarity was defined using standard text similarity measures. Two clinicians performed chart review of all cases to determine whether the first, non-completed medication order had a documented or non-documented, plausible indication for use. If either reviewer found a plausible indication, the case was not considered an error. We analyzed 127,458 alerts and identified 176 intercepted drug name confusion errors, an interception rate of 0.14±.01%.', 'title Learning from adverse events and near misses may reduce the incidence of preventable errors. Current literature on adverse events and near misses in the ICU focuses on errors reported by nurses and intensivists. ICU near misses identified by anesthesia providers may reveal critical events, causal mechanisms and system weaknesses not identified by other providers, and may differ in character and causality from near misses in other anesthesia locations. We analyzed events reported to our anesthesia near miss reporting system from 2009 to 2011. We compared causative mechanisms of ICU near misses with near misses in other anesthesia locations. A total of 1,811 near misses were reported, of which 22 (1.2 %) originated in the ICU. Five causal mechanisms explained over half of ICU near misses. Compared to near misses from other locations, near misses from the ICU were more likely to occur while on call (45 % vs. 19 %, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), and were more likely to be associated with airway management (50 % vs. 12 %, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). ICU near misses were less likely to be associated with equipment issues (23 % vs. 48 %, p\\u2009=\\u20090.02).', \"title Adverse events resulting from medication error are a serious concern. Patients' literacy and their ability to understand medication information are increasingly seen as a safety issue. To examine whether adult patients receiving primary care services at a public hospital clinic were able to correctly interpret commonly used prescription medication warning labels. In-person structured interviews with literacy assessment. Public hospital, primary care clinic. A total of 251 adult patients waiting for an appointment at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) Primary Care Clinic. Correct interpretation, as determined by expert panel review of patients' verbatim responses, for each of 8 commonly used prescription medication warning labels. Approximately one-third of patients (n=74) were reading at or below the 6th-grade level (low literacy). Patient comprehension of warning labels was associated with one's literacy level. Multistep instructions proved difficult for patients across all literacy levels. After controlling for relevant potential confounding variables, patients with low literacy were 3.4 times less likely to interpret prescription medication warning labels correctly (95% confidence interval: 2.3 to 4.9).\", 'title Communication failures are a significant cause of preventable medical errors, and poor-quality handoffs are associated with adverse events. We developed and implemented a simple checklist to improve communication during intraoperative transfer of patient care. A prospective observational assessment was performed to compare relay and retention of critical patient information between the outgoing and incoming anesthesiologist before and after introduction of an electronic handoff checklist. Secondary measurements included checklist usage and clinician satisfaction. Sixty-nine handoffs were observed (39 with and 30 without the checklist). Significant improvements in the frequency of information relay occurred with checklist use, most notably related to administration of vasopressors and antiemetics (85% vs 44%, P = 0.008; 46% vs 15%, P = 0.015, respectively); estimated blood loss and urine output (85% vs 57%, P = 0.014; 85% vs 52%, P = 0.006, respectively); communication about potential areas of concern (92% vs 57%, P = 0.001), postoperative planning (92% vs 43%, P < 0.001), and introduction of the relieving anesthesiologist to the operating team (51% vs 3%, P < 0.001). When queried after the handoff, relieving anesthesiologists more frequently knew the antibiotic (97% vs 75%, P = 0.020), muscle relaxant (97% vs 63%, P = 0.003), and amount of fluid administered (97% vs 72%, P = 0.008) when the checklist was used. Voluntary use of the checklist occurred in 60% of the handoffs by the end of the observation period (99% control limits: 58%-75%.). Clinicians who reported using the checklist in at least two-thirds of their handoffs reported higher satisfaction with quality of communication at handoff (P = 0.003).', \"title Ineffective communications among healthcare providers are common and increases the risk of medical errors. During the perioperative period, multiple handoffs occur within a short period of time, and failure to convey important patient information can compromise safety. We used quality improvement methodology to improve the reliability of our handoffs in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Two quality improvement teams were developed to focus on the intraoperative and postanesthesia handoff processes. Key driver diagrams and 'smart aims' were developed for each process based on feedback from anesthesia and nursing staff, and handoff checklists were developed and revised using multiple plan-do-study-act cycles. Data on the reliability of the handoff processes were obtained prior to initiation of the projects and throughout the 6-month project period. The reliability of intraoperative anesthesia handoffs improved from 20% to 100% with use of the intraoperative handoff checklist. Similarly, with the introduction of a standardized PACU checklist, the reliability of PACU handoffs improved from 59% to greater than 90%.\", \"title To analyse the frequency of mistakes in communication between the physician and the patient and their incidence in errors in self-administered drugs. We undertook a descriptive, cross-sectional study based on interviews with a random sample of patients older than 65 years who were polymedicated (five or more drugs) and had multiple comorbidities. Data were analysed about the patients' reports of what the physician said, medication mistakes by the patients and their consequences. Responses were provided by 382 patients. A medication error in the last year was reported by 287 patients (75%), and 16 patients (4%) reported four or more errors. Most cases concerned the dosage, a similar appearance of the medication or a lack of understanding of the physician's instructions. Very severe consequences occurred in 19 cases (5%). Multiple comorbidities (P = 0.006) and a greater number of treatments (P = 0.002) were associated with making mistakes. Frequent changes in prescription (P = 0.02), not considering the prescriptions of other physicians (P = 0.01), inconsistency in the messages (P = 0.01), being treated by various different physicians at the same time (P = 0.03), a feeling of not being listened to (P < 0.001) or loss of trust in the physician (P < 0.001) were associated with making medication mistakes.\", 'title Medication errors are a common source of adverse events. Errors in the home medication list may impact care in the Emergency Department (ED), the hospital, and the home. Medication reconciliation, a Joint Commission requirement, begins with an accurate home medication list. To evaluate the accuracy of the ED home medication list. Prospective, observational study of patients aged > 64 years admitted to the hospital. After obtaining informed consent, a home medication list was compiled by research staff after consultation with the patient, their family and, when appropriate, their pharmacy and primary care doctor. This home medication list was not available to ED staff and was not placed in the ED chart. ED records were then reviewed by a physician, blinded to the research-generated home medication list, using a standardized data sheet to record the ED list of medications. The research-generated home medication list was compared to the standard medication list and the number of omissions, duplications, and dosing errors was determined. There were 98 patients enrolled in the study; 56% (55/98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 46-66%) of the medication lists for these patients had an omission and 80% (78/98, 95% CI 70-87%) had a dosing or frequency error; 87% of ED medication lists had at least one error (85/98, 95% CI 78-93%).', 'title To improve medication history accuracy and reduce prescribing errors for unscheduled patients admitted via the emergency department (ED). A prospective observational study of 100 adult unscheduled admissions with 50 patients in both pre and post-intervention groups. One investigator completed the required information including patient demographics, admitting speciality, number and types of any medication errors detected. In the post-intervention group, the investigator (a pharmacist independent prescriber) completed systematic medicine reconciliation in the ED before patient transfer and initiated the original inpatient prescription chart, as appropriate.

With this in mind, assessing the effect of reporting errors should be a cause worth pursuing. The object in this study was to examine the null hypothesis that recording and publishing errors do not affect error patterns in a clinical practice. Intraoperative errors and their characteristics were prospectively recorded between May 2000 and May 2013 in the neurosurgical practice of the senior author (M.B.). The error pattern observed between May 2000 and August 2006, which has been previously described (Group A), was compared with the error pattern observed between September 2006 and May 2013 (Group B). A total of 1108 cases in Group A and 974 cases in Group B were surgically treated. A total of 2684 errors were recorded in Group A, while 1892 errors were recorded in Group B. The ratios of cranial to spinal procedures performed in Groups A and B were 3:1 and 10:1, respectively, while the ratios of general to local anesthesia in the two groups were 2:1 and 1.3:1, respectively (p < 0.0001 for both). There was a significantly decreased proportion of cases with error (87% to 83%, p < 0.006), mean errors per case (2.4 to 1.9, p < 0.0001), proportion of error-related complications (16.7% to 5.5%, p < 0.002), and clinical impacts of error (2.7% to 1.0%, p < 0.0001) in Group B compared with Group A. Errors in Group B tended to be more preventable than those in Group A (85.8% vs 78.5%, p < 0.0001). A significant reduction was also noticed with most types of error. A descending trend in the mean errors per case was demonstrated from the years 2001 to 2012; however, an increased severity of errors (22.6% to 29.5%, p < 0.0001) was recorded in Group B compared with Group A.', \"title Automated clinical decision support has shown promise in reducing medication errors; however, clinicians often do not comply with alerts. Because renal insufficiency is a common source of medication errors, the authors studied a trial of alerts designed to reduce inpatient administration of medications contraindicated due to renal insufficiency. A minimum safe creatinine clearance was established for each inpatient formulary medication. Alerts recommending cancellation appeared when a medication order was initiated for a patient whose estimated creatinine clearance was less than the minimum safe creatinine clearance for the medication. Administration of medications in patients with creatinine clearances less than the medication's minimum safe clearance were studied for 14 months after, and four months before, alert implementation. In addition, the impact of patient age, gender, degree of renal dysfunction, time of day, and duration of housestaff training on the likelihood of housestaff compliance with the alerts was examined. The likelihood of a patient receiving at least one dose of contraindicated drug after the order was initiated decreased from 89% to 47% (p < 0.0001) after alert implementation. Analysis of the alerts seen by housestaff showed that alert compliance was higher in male patients (57% vs. 38%, p = 0.02), increased with the duration of housestaff training (p = 0.04), and increased in patients with worsening renal function (p = 0.007).\"]"

To determine in patients with melanoma the expression of the cytotoxic mediators perforin and granzyme A in peripheral blood natural killer (NK) and T cells, we used flow cytometry before and after IFN-alpha administration.

In this study, we investigated the role of NF-κB signaling pathway in the regulation of CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) in neuroblastoma metastasis. NF-κB, CXCR4 mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR, and Western blot. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was used to induce the upregulation of NF-κB and CXCR4. The knockdown of NF-κB and CXCR4 was achieved by PDTC. Transwell assay was used to investigate the role of NF-κB (P65) in neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion. An in vitro co-culture system was established to investigate the role of tumor microenvironment in regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Over-expression of NF-κB (p65) promoted tumor migration and invasion through the upregulation of CXCR4; however, knockdown of NF-κB(P65) inhibited tumor migration and invasion through blocking the expression of CXCR4. Consistently, in the co-culture system, the expression of CXCR4 was partly dependent on the expression of NF-κB (p65).', 'title Metastasis suppressor-1 (MTSS1) is a novel potential metastasis suppressor gene in several types of human cancers. However, the exact function and regulatory mechanism of MTSS1 in Tongue squamous cellular carcinoma (TSCC) have not been elucidated. We first confirmed the MTSS1 gene expression by using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining. Then we detected the effect of MTSS1 gene on Tca8113 cells proliferation and invasion ability by using MTT, wound healing and invasion assay. Finally by using bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay and a serial method, we analyzed the targeting of miR-96 on MTSS1 and the ability of miR-96 on MTSS1 gene mediated biological alterations in Tca8113 cells. Our findings showed that the expression of MTSS1 was down-regulated in both TSCC tissues and Tca8113 cells. Forced expression of MTSS1 led to inhibited cell proliferation ability, retarded wound closing and reduced trans-membrane cell numbers. MiR-96 is confirmed to be a direct target of MTSS1 gene and could regulate MTSS1 mediated Tca8113 cells proliferation and metastasis. But miR-96 could not completely restore the invasion ability of Tca8113 cells.', 'title Increasing evidence indicates an important role of transcription factor Yin Yang-1 (YY1) in human tumorigenesis. However, its function in cancer remains controversial and the relevance of YY1 to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains to be clarified. In this study, we detected YY1 expression in clinical PDAC tissue samples and cell lines using quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. We also detected MUC4 and MMP10 mRNA levels in 108 PDAC samples using qRT-PCR and analyzed the correlations between YY1 and MUC4 or MMP10 expression. The role of YY1 in the proliferation, invasion and metastatic abilities of PDAC cells in vitro was studied by CCK-8 assay, cell migration and invasion assays. In vivo pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis was studied by a xenogenous subcutaneously implant model and a tail vein metastasis model. The potential mechanisms underlying YY1 mediated tumor progression in PDAC were explored by digital gene expression (DGE) sequencing, signal transduction pathways blockage experiments and luciferase assays. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 15.0 software. We found that the expression of YY1 in PDACs was higher compared with their adjacent non-tumorous tissues and normal pancreas tissues. However, PDAC patients with high level overexpression of YY1 had better outcome than those with low level overexpression. YY1 expression levels were statistically negatively correlated with MMP10 expression levels, but not correlated with MUC4 expression levels. YY1 overexpression suppressed, whereas YY1 knockdown enhanced, the proliferation, invasion and metastatic properties of BXPC-3 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. YY1 suppresses invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells by downregulating MMP10 in a MUC4/ErbB2/p38/MEF2C-dependent mechanism.', 'title TGF-β plays a key role in the progression of various tumors. The main objective of our study was to investigate whether TGF-β is able to regulate N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression in a mouse model by inducing Treg cell polarization. HCC progression, TGF-β and Foxp3 expression levels, serum TGF-β, IL10 and GP73 levels as well as percentage of Treg cells were analyzed in healthy, HCC and HCC+SM-16 mouse groups. The effect of TGF-β on Treg cell polarization in vitro was measured by flow cytometric analysis. The expression of TGF-β and IL10 was identified by IHC in HCC patients and the correlation between TGF-β and IL10 was also assessed. TGF-β expression is up-regulated in a DEN-induced HCC mouse model. TGF-β can promote the differentiation of Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells (Treg cells) in vitro. However, blocking the TGF-β pathway with a specific TGF-β receptor inhibitor, SM-16, reduced HCC progression and the percentage of Treg cells in liver tissue. The correlation between TGF-β and Treg cells was also confirmed in HCC patients and the expression of both TGF-β and IL-10 was shown to be associated with HCC progression.', 'title Metastasis associated gene-1 (MTA1), was initially discovered in aggressive human cancer cell lines and has been subsequently associated with the invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the expression levels of MTA1 in a cohort of human pituitary tumors (n=95) and examined the relationship between MTA1 expression and the pathological, clinical and aggressiveness of these tumors. MTA1 was expressed at significantly higher levels in large tumors and in those with higher tumor grade. It was also observed that tumors that had invaded the suprasellar bones and tumors that destructed the sella had significantly higher levels than those without bone involvement (p<005). Although there did not appear to exist any relationship between MTA1 and cystic lesions in the tumors, endocrine-active tumors, namely those secreting prolactin, growth hormone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) had significantly lower MTA1 transcript levels than inactive tumors.', \"title The aim of this study was to investigate the association of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression with improved survival in patients with glioblastomas multiforme (GBMs). Immune and vascular host-tumor interactions play a pivotal role in the control of tumor development, and inflammatory mechanisms may participate in the host's defense against tumor cells. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been noted in various types of malignant tumors, raising the possibility that endogenous expression of cytokines and the resulting cytotoxic action of sustained NO production play a role in the control of tumor growth. Indeed, human GBMs express variable amounts of iNOS. In this study, the expression of iNOS and of cytokines known to upregulate IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma or downregulate iNOS transcription (IL-10, transforming growth factor [TGF]beta1, and TGFbeta2) were measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with competitor DNA in 39 samples of human GBM. The iNOS level in GBM was positively correlated with IL-1beta messenger (m)RNA, but not with the other cytokines tested. Immunocytochemical double labeling revealed that both anti-iNOS immunoreactivity and anti-IL-1beta immunoreactivity colocalized with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in GBM. Some macrophage/microglial cells also expressed iNOS, but not IL-1beta. Comparison of biological data with clinical parameters indicated that the survival duration was enhanced when levels of IL-1beta mRNA were elevated or when levels of TGFbeta2 were low, but was independent of the level of iNOS mRNA within the tumor.\", 'title As a novel candidate metastasis suppressor gene, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated gene 6 (NGX6) is involved in cellular growth, cell cycle progression and tumor angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that NGX6 gene is down-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, little is known about its transcriptional regulation. We defined the minimal promoter of NGX6 gene in a 186-bp region (from-86 to +100) through mutation construct methods and luciferase assays. Results from Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that Early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binds to the Sp1/Egr-1 overlapping site of NGX6 minimal promoter. Overexpression of Egr-1 increased the promoter activity and mRNA level of NGX6 gene; while knock-down of endogenous Egr-1 decreased mRNA expression of NGX6 gene.', 'title Proteins on cell surface play important roles during cancer progression and metastasis via their ability to mediate cell-to-cell interactions and navigate the communication between cells and the microenvironment. In this study a targeted proteomic analysis was conducted to identify the differential expression of cell surface proteins in human benign (BPH-1) versus malignant (LNCaP and PC-3) prostate epithelial cells. We identified EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) as a key candidate and shRNA functional approaches were subsequently applied to determine the role of EMMPRIN in prostate cancer cell adhesion, migration, invasion as well as cytoskeleton organization. EMMPRIN was found to be highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells compared to BPH-1 cells, consistent with a correlation between elevated EMMPRIN and metastasis found in other tumors. No significant changes in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, or apoptosis were detected in EMMPRIN knockdown cells compared to the scramble controls. Furthermore, EMMPRIN silencing markedly decreased the ability of PC-3 cells to form filopodia, a critical feature of invasive behavior, while it increased expression of cell-cell adhesion and gap junction proteins.', 'title Tumor-derived matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin-C (TN-C) have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of how these proteins contribute to tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Importantly, these matricellular proteins are known to interact with α9β1 integrin. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor-derived α9β1 integrin may contribute to tumor progression. To clarify the roles of α9β1 integrin in tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis, we used an inhibitory anti-human α9β1 integrin antibody (anti-hα9β1 antibody) and a α9β1 integrin-positive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo orthotopic xenotransplantation model. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor, but not host α9β1 integrin, contributes to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and host-derived OPN production. We also found that CAFs contributed to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and host-derived OPN levels. Consistent with those findings, tumor volume was well-correlated with numbers of CAFs and levels of host-derived OPN. Furthermore, it was shown that the inoculation of D3H2LN cells into mammary fat pads with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), obtained from wild type, but not OPN knock-out mice, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth, thus indicating that CAF-derived OPN enhanced tumor growth. These results suggested that tumor α9β1-mediated signaling plays a pivotal role in generating unique primary tumor tissue microenvironments, which favor lymphatic metastasis and tumor growth.']"

We demonstrated previously that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is associated with short-term progression of carotid atherosclerosis. We now investigated whether baseline levels of hs-CRP predict midterm clinical outcome in these patients. We prospectively studied 1065 of 1268 consecutive patients who were initially asymptomatic with respect to carotid artery disease and were investigated with serial carotid ultrasound examinations at baseline and after a 6- to 9-month interval. Patients were followed-up clinically for the occurrence of cardiovascular events, a composite of myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, stroke, and death. We recorded progression of carotid stenosis in 93 patients (9%) after 6 to 9 months, and 381 cardiovascular events in 337 patients (27%) during a median of 3 years of clinical follow-up (interquartile range, 2.5 to 3.5 years). The hs-CRP levels were significantly elevated in patients with progressive carotid stenosis (P<0.001), and hs-CRP was significantly associated with the occurrence of a first future cardiovascular event (P<0.001). Adjusted hazard ratios for a first cardiovascular event for increasing quintiles of hs-CRP were 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 2.17), 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 2.66), 2.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 3.32), and 2.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 3.60) as compared with the lowest quintile, respectively. This association was independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the baseline degree of carotid stenosis.', 'title Several previous epidemiological studies have suggested that high plasma concentrations of carotenoids may slow the development of early atherosclerosis, but results have been inconclusive. We examined the effect of carotenoids on early atherosclerosis in a population-based study. The association between plasma carotenoid concentrations and intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCA-IMT) was investigated in 1212 elderly men (aged 61-80 years) in Eastern Finland. They were examined by B-mode ultrasound to detect early signs of carotid atherosclerosis, and plasma concentrations of carotenoids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Men in the lowest quartile of CCA-IMT had significantly higher concentrations of plasma β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene and α-carotene than men in the highest quartile (P for the differences: 0.043, 0.045 and 0.046, respectively), after adjustment for age, examination year, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, years of education, symptomatic coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD history, diabetes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, medications and season. The concentrations of plasma β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene and α-carotene decreased linearly with increasing CCA-IMT.', 'title Women with Turner syndrome (TS) have greater carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) known to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis in adults. To determine whether there are risk factors for atherosclerosis in children with TS, we compared cIMT, anthropometric and metabolic parameters between children with TS and healthy controls. Data of children with TS with XO karyotype (n=24, mean age: 11.6±3.6) were compared with those of healthy children (n=24, mean age: 10.5±3.6) with respect to anthropometric parameters, lipid levels, insulin resistance and cIMT which was measured by high resolution B-mode ultrasonography. Mean age and cIMT values were similar in the two groups of children. However in children with TS, fasting glucose (p=0.01), total cholesterol (p=0.006), triglyceride (p=0.04) levels and HDL-cholesterol (p=0.002) levels were higher than those of controls. In the TS group, cIMT correlated positively with LDL-cholesterol (r=0.435, p=0.034) and with systolic blood pressure (r=0.430, p=0.036) and negatively with HDL-cholesterol (r=-0.518, p=0.01). In stepwise regression analysis, HDL-cholesterol emerged as a significant predictor of cIMT (b= -0.518, p=0.01) contributing to 26.8 % of its variability.', 'title We investigated factors for carotid artery inflammation by [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Inflammation is present in some atherosclerotic plaques. The FDG-PET is capable of identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques. The FDG-PET imaging was performed in 216 consecutive patients (63 +/- 9 years, men:women 147:69) for cancer screening. Vascular inflammation in carotid atherosclerosis was quantified by measuring the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG into the artery. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed significant relationships between SUV and waist circumference (p < 0.001), hypertensive medication (p < 0.001), carotid intima-media thickness (p < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01, inversely), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (p < 0.05), or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p < 0.05). Age- and gender-adjusted SUV of FDG was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in proportion to the accumulation of the number of the components of the metabolic syndrome. Thus, the metabolic syndrome was associated with increased FDG uptake in carotid atherosclerosis.', 'title We evaluated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as an early marker of atherosclerosis, as well as its main determinants among androgen excess, obesity and insulin resistance, in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We selected 40 PCOS patients and 20 non-hyperandrogenic women who were similar in terms of age and grade of obesity. Complete clinical, metabolic and hormonal profiles and left common CIMT measurements were obtained. Patients with PCOS presented with increased mean CIMT values when compared with controls (F = 8.575; P = 0.005), and this was independent of obesity. Five PCOS patients but no controls had increased CIMT values. CIMT correlated directly with serum total and free testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels and mean 24-h heart rate (HR), and inversely with the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), but no correlation was observed with the body mass index (BMI). Multiple stepwise linear regression models showed that in PCOS patients, the main determinants of CIMT were serum total testosterone or androstenedione concentrations, with no influence of ISI or the mean 24-h HR.', 'title This study investigated the relationship between aortic 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake and clinical and laboratory findings related to atherosclerosis in a general population. 18F-FDG uptake in the ascending aorta was measured on the positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans of 211 Japanese adults. The maximum target-to-background ratio (TBR) was compared with clinical and laboratory atherosclerosis findings.

Furthermore, by multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors, TBR-A was significantly correlated with LDL-C (β\\u200a=\\u200a0.001, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.03) and log-leptin (β\\u200a=\\u200a0.336, p<0.01) in all subjects.', 'title Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a potential indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).

Forty patients with MetS were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched subjects without MetS in terms of echocardiographic EFT, CIMT, anthropometric measurements, and metabolic profile in this cross-sectional study. The waist circumference, total and LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, triglycerides, systolics and diastolic blood pressure levels, hs-CRP, and homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly increased in patients with MetS. The EFT and CIMT were also increased significantly in patients with MetS compared to controls (7.2 ± 2 mm vs. 5.7 ± 1.9 mm; P = 0.001, 0.74 ± 0.1 mm vs. 0.59 ± 0.1 mm; P < 0.01, respectively).

However, its biological significance in atherosclerosis remains controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether DHEAS is associated with development of carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 419 Japanese individuals (208 males and 211 females) were recruited from Tokushima University Hospital, Japan. In all subjects, maximum intima-media thickness (max-IMT) in all carotid arteries, and mean-IMT and mean blood flow volume (BFV) in the common carotid arteries (CCA) were measured by ultrasonography; endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery (%FMD). Serum DHEAS and classical cardiovascular risk factors were also evaluated. Statistical significance was determined by multiple regression analysis to elucidate independent determinants of max-IMT, mean-IMT, mean CCA-BFV, and %FMD. Serum DHEAS levels were higher in males than in females. Multiple regression analysis revealed that DHEAS was an independent negative factor for both max-IMT and mean-IMT in males but not in females. In contrast, DHEAS was the sole positive factor for mean CCA-BFV in females but not in males. In addition, there was no significant relationship between %FMD and DHEAS regardless of sex and other confounding factors.']"

Angiogenin values were significantly elevated in patients with high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (median 31.1 [range 9.2 to 54.6] vs 17.1 [range 9.0 to 29.2] ng/ml, p = 0.02). Mean gestational age at sampling, maternal age, and year of amniocentesis were not significantly different between the study and control groups (each p > 0.05). As anticipated, there was a significant increase in preterm deliveries and small-for-gestational-age neonates in the patients with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (each p < 0.01).', \"title Elevated mid-trimester human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcome. The aims of the study were to evaluate the association between elevated hCG, fetal pathological arterial waveforms and maternal and perinatal complications. Pulsatility indices (PI) of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) were determined prospectively in 121 consecutive patients with abnormal maternal serum hCG (> 2.5 MoM). Each patient had four US scans during pregnancy. Patients with known structural or chromosomal anomalies were excluded. Of 121 women with hCG > 2.5 MoM, 36/121(29.6%) had hCG between 2.5 and 3.0 MoM, 35/121(28.9%) had hCG between 3.0 and 3.5 MoM, 21/121(17.3%) had hCG of 3.5-4.0 MoM, 17/121(14.1%) had hCG levels between 4.0 and 4.5 MoM, and 12/121(9.9%) had hCG > 4.5 MoM. Middle cerebral artery PI was significantly lower in women with hCG > 4.0 MoM between 28 and 36 weeks' gestation, but not between 18 and 27 weeks' gestation. No differences of MCA PI were found when the cut-off point of hCG was 3.5. Women with hCG levels > 4.0 MoM had a significantly higher rate of preterm deliveries, cesarean sections, higher rate of Apgar scores < 7 and a significantly lower mean birth weight in comparison with women with hCG < 4.0 MoM. The prevalence of PIH and preeclampsia and perinatal death were found to be higher among patients with hCG levels > 4.0 MoM, although not significantly. No differences were found at hCG levels less than 4.0 MoM.\", 'title The association of growth retardation and hypospadias is well established. Fetal testosterone secretion is under the influence of placental human chorionic gonadotropin during first 14 weeks of gestation. We hypothesized that placental insufficiency may disrupt the supply of nutrients and human chorionic gonadotropin to the fetus leading to both growth retardation and hypospadias. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed extremely low-birth-weight male infants with or without hypospadias for fetal growth parameters. One hundred four male newborn infants with birth body weight of less than 1500 g admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit over a 4-year period were retrospectively reviewed, recording the presence and type of hypospadias, fetal growth parameters, infant growth parameters at birth, placental weight, placental histopathology, cord information, and maternal morbidity. These data of patients with hypospadias were compared with those of controls. Of the 104 extremely to very low-birth-weight male infants, 16 (15.3%) had hypospadias, and 10 (62.5%) of those had severe proximal hypospadias. Sixty-two controls who did not have hypospadias and whose body weight was less than 1500 g were identified. The incidence of hypospadias in full-term male birth in the hospital was 12 (0.30%) in 3959 births. Birth body weight and their SD for gestational age were lower in patients with hypospadias compared with those for controls (824 +/- 160 vs 1255 +/- 145 g). Placenta-to-fetal ratio (0.323 +/- 0.07 vs 0.229 +/- 0.03) and gestational age were significantly higher in the patients with hypospadias. Histopathologic study of the maternal placenta obtained from the patients with hypospadias revealed pronounced degenerative changes, infarction, and calcification, whereas these abnormalities were rare in controls.', \"title Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality and contributes substantially to medically indicated preterm birth; preventing fetal death. Molecular profiling of the mothers' peripheral blood was desired to monitor the health conditions of the fetuses. To develop such a minimally invasive assay, we applied a protein affinity fractionation method to peripheral blood serum samples from pregnant women belonging to either the IUGR or to the control group. Proof-of-principle was shown by relative quantitation analysis of mixtures of intact proteoforms using MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The two best differentiating proteins and proteoforms, respectively, were apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-III\", 'title Preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are associated with elevated concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase, which indicate maternal neutrophil activation. The aim of the study was to measure maternal MPO and PMN elastase plasma concentrations in second trimester pregnancies with pathological uterine perfusion that are a high risk group for preeclampsia and IUGR, and compare them to normal controls. The study includes 25 pregnancies with normal and 25 pregnancies with pathological uterine perfusion. In both groups, doppler-sonographic measurement of uterine perfusion was performed in the twenty-first week of gestation. Maternal plasma concentrations of MPO and PMN elastase were measured using a specific ELISA for both enzymes. The plasma MPO concentration of pregnant women with normal perfusion did not differ significantly from that of the group with pathological perfusion (27.4 +/- 3.3 vs. 23.7 +/- 2.0 ng/mL). Likewise, the plasma PMN elastase-concentration also did not show a significant difference between the groups (5.7 +/- 0.5 ng/mL normal vs. 8.0 +/- 1.0 ng/mL pathological). Patients with pathological perfusion that later developed preeclampsia or IUGR (9/25) showed unchanged MPO and PMN elastase values in the second trimenon compared to those with pathological perfusion and normal outcome.', 'title Placental growth hormone (PGH) is synthesised by the placenta, and its function is modulated by growth hormone binding protein (GHBP). The potential of PGH and GHBP as maternal serum screening markers for Down syndrome (DS) was examined. Maternal serum concentrations of PGH and GHBP were determined by ELISA in 74 DS and 261 control pregnancies in gestational week 8(+0) to 13(+4). Log(10) MoM distributions of the markers were established. The performance of DS screening was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. PGH log(10) MoM (SD) was decreased (p < 0.001) to -0.201 (0.373) and GHBP log(10) MoM to -0.116 (0.265) (p = 0.04), in DS pregnancies (n = 34) in week 8(+0) to 10(+0). In week 10(+1) to 13(+4), neither PGH (p = 0.16) nor GHBP (p = 0.13) was reduced in DS pregnancies. The detection rate (DR) for PGH in screening for DS in week 8(+0) to 10(+0) was 39% for a false positive rate (FPR) of 5%; increasing to 72% in combination with PAPP-A + hCGbeta. PGH + GHBP in combination with PAPP-A + hCGbeta + nuchal translucency (NT) (CUB test) had a DR of 91% compared with 80% for the CUB test.', 'title Shortly after birth, pituitary gonadotropin secretion transiently activates in both sexes, and this surge is more robust in preterm (PT) than in full-term (FT) infants. In boys, the gonadotropin surge is associated with testicular activity and is considered an important part of normal reproductive development. In contrast, gonadal activation and its consequences in infant girls are poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the association of postnatal ovarian activity with simultaneous changes in estrogen target tissues in FT and PT girls. We measured urinary estradiol (E₂) levels in 29 FT and 34 PT girls using a mass spectrometric method from 1 week (D7) to 6 months of age (M1-M6). To assess the contribution of ovarian E₂ on urinary E₂ levels, the levels in girls were compared with the levels of boys of similar cohorts (29 FT and 33 PT boys). E₂ levels were compared with simultaneous changes in estrogenic target tissues including mammary glands in both sexes and uterus and vulvar epithelium in girls. Median urinary E₂ levels increased after D7 in girls, but not in boys. Mammary gland diameter was larger in girls than in boys from M4 in FT (P < .001) and M2 in PT infants (P < .0001). In PT girls, E₂ levels increased at term and were then higher than those in FT girls (P < .0001). Urinary E₂ levels in PT girls were positively associated with mammary gland and uterine growth.', 'title Can gonadotrophin receptor variants separately or in combination, be used for the prediction of pregnancy chances in in vitro fertilization (IVF) trials?', 'title Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency occurs in 5-10% of pregnancies and is a major risk factor for abnormal neurodevelopment. The perinatal diagnosis of IUGR related abnormal neurodevelopment represents a major challenge in fetal medicine. The development of clinical biomarkers is considered a promising approach, but requires the identification of biochemical/molecular alterations by IUGR in the fetal brain. This targeted metabolomics study in a rabbit IUGR model aimed to obtain mechanistic insight into the effects of IUGR on the fetal brain and identify metabolite candidates for biomarker development. At gestation day 25, IUGR was induced in two New Zealand rabbits by 40-50% uteroplacental vessel ligation in one horn and the contralateral horn was used as control. At day 30, fetuses were delivered by Cesarian section, weighed and brains collected for metabolomics analysis. Results showed that IUGR fetuses had a significantly lower birth and brain weight compared to controls. Metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) and database matching identified 78 metabolites. Comparison of metabolite intensities using a t-test demonstrated that 18 metabolites were significantly different between control and IUGR brain tissue, including neurotransmitters/peptides, amino acids, fatty acids, energy metabolism intermediates and oxidative stress metabolites. Principle component and hierarchical cluster analysis showed cluster formations that clearly separated control from IUGR brain tissue samples, revealing the potential to develop predictive biomarkers. Moreover birth weight and metabolite intensity correlations indicated that the extent of alterations was dependent on the severity of IUGR.', 'title The present study examines the hypothesis that the elevated levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and interleukin (IL)-10 would be protective for the fetus survival during pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Moreover, we evaluate the IL-12 and IL-15 serum concentrations and their relationships with PIH. Serum samples were obtained before the onset of labor from control and PIH groups. Cytokine concentrations were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunoadsorbent Assay. Our data show that PIH women have significantly higher TGF-beta1 and IL-10 concentrations with respect to control groups (P = 0.0001). Similarly, macrophages from the PIH placentas produce in vitro more elevated TGF-beta1 and IL-10 levels compared to normal pregnant ones (P = 0.02), also in the absence of LPS stimulation. IL-12 and IL-15 serum concentrations were not detectable in all pregnant groups.']"

To determine whether a panel of fMRI tasks targeting different aspects of language processing increases accuracy in determining hemisphere language dominance. Twenty-six patients age 12 to 56 years, predominantly with temporal lobe epilepsy, were studied using whole-brain 1.5 T fMRI (echo planar imaging, blood oxygenation level-dependent) with three task categories using a block design: verbal fluency, reading comprehension, and auditory comprehension. fMRI t maps were visually rated at three thresholds. All patients had assessment of language lateralization by IAT. fMRI showed left dominance in 21 patients, right dominance in 2, and bilateral activation in 2; raters disagreed over a left vs right bilateral rating in 1 patient. There was full agreement between IAT and fMRI in 21 of 25 patients (IAT failed in 1). In three instances of partial disparity with IAT, the fMRI panel showed consistent findings across raters. Agreement between raters was excellent (partial disagreement in only one patient); the panel of tasks was superior to any single task for interrater agreement (Cramer V 0.93 [range 0.91 to 1.0] vs 0.72 [range 0.60 to 0.86]).', 'title The present study investigated the neural correlates of sign language processing of Deaf people who had learned German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS) from their Deaf parents as their first language. Correct and incorrect signed sentences were presented sign by sign on a computer screen. At the end of each sentence the participants had to judge whether or not the sentence was an appropriate DGS sentence. Two types of violations were introduced: (1) semantically incorrect sentences containing a selectional restriction violation (implausible object); (2) morphosyntactically incorrect sentences containing a verb that was incorrectly inflected (i.e., incorrect direction of movement). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 74 scalp electrodes. Semantic violations (implausible signs) elicited an N400 effect followed by a positivity. Sentences with a morphosyntactic violation (verb agreement violation) elicited a negativity followed by a broad centro-parietal positivity.', 'title Assessment of language dominance with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropsychological evaluation is often used prior to epilepsy surgery. This study explores whether language lateralization and cognitive performance are systematically related in young patients with focal epilepsy. Language fMRI and neuropsychological data (language, visuospatial functions, and memory) of 40 patients (7-18 years of age) with unilateral, refractory focal epilepsy in temporal and/or frontal areas of the left (n = 23) or right hemisphere (n = 17) were analyzed. fMRI data of 18 healthy controls (7-18 years) served as a normative sample. A laterality index was computed to determine the lateralization of activation in three regions of interest (frontal, parietal, and temporal). Atypical language lateralization was demonstrated in 12 (30%) of 40 patients. A correlation between language lateralization and verbal memory performance occurred in patients with left-sided epilepsy over all three regions of interest, with bilateral or right-sided language lateralization being correlated with better verbal memory performance (Word Pairs Recall: frontal r = -0.4, p = 0.016; parietal r = -0.4, p = 0.043; temporal r = -0.4, p = 0.041). Verbal memory performance made the largest contribution to language lateralization, whereas handedness and side of seizures did not contribute to the variance in language lateralization.', 'title To investigate the degree of language dominance in patients with left and right hemisphere seizure foci compared to normal volunteers using a fMRI reading comprehension task. Fifty patients with complex partial epilepsy, aged 8 to 56 years and 33 normal volunteers, aged 7 to 34 had fMRI (1.5 T) and neuropsychological testing. Participants silently named an object described by a sentence compared to a visual control. Data were analyzed with region of interest (ROI) analysis based on t maps for inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), midfrontal gyrus (MFG), and Wernicke area (WA). Regional asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated [(L - R)/(L + R)]; AI > 0.20 was deemed left dominant and AI < 0.20 as atypical language. Left hemisphere focus patients had a higher likelihood of atypical language than right hemisphere focus patients (21% vs 0%, chi2 < 0.002). Left hemisphere focus patients, excluding those with atypical language, had lower regional AI in IFG, MFG, and WA than controls. Right hemisphere focus patients were all left language dominant and had a lower AI than controls in WA and MFG, but not for IFG. AI in MFG and WA were similar between left hemisphere focus/left language patients and right hemisphere focus patients. Patients activated more voxels than healthy volunteers. Lower AIs were attributable to greater activation in right homologous regions. Less activation in the right-side WA correlated with better verbal memory performance in right focus/left hemisphere-dominant patients, whereas less strongly lateralized activation in IFG correlated better with Verbal IQ in left focus/left hemisphere-dominant patients.', 'title We examined potential differences in the effects of pathology type on language lateralization in pediatric epilepsy. We examined findings from intracarotid sodium amobarbital procedure (IAP/Wada) in a large consecutive sample of children with refractory epilepsy. Subjects were assigned to one of three pathology groups: developmental (n = 28), acquired (n = 26), and tumor (n = 20); groups were compared for language lateralization. Rates of atypical language lateralization did not differ across groups. Greater than half of the subjects with left hemisphere insults and seizure onset before 6 years of age had atypical language lateralization, independent of pathology type.', 'title Little is known about how treatment affects the neural substrate of language function in stroke sufferers. In the present study authors investigated neuronal correlates of treatment induced recovery of language functions in patients with chronic aphasia. In 10 chronic aphasia patients and 10 age- and gender-matched control participants, evoked high-frequency activity (HFA, >20 Hz) was determined from the magnetoencephalogram in an automatic word recognition task, in which content, function, and pseudowords were visually presented at fast rate (350-ms). Recording was repeated after 2 weeks, in aphasics after intensive language training to evaluate training effects, in controls to establish HFA stability. In the first recording, bilateral HFA distribution in controls contrasted right-hemispheric predominance in the patients. After training, this right>left asymmetry in aphasics was reduced to a bilateral pattern similar to controls. While word class did not substantially affect HFA patterns in the two groups, enhanced right-hemispheric HFA in the patients varied with better language function (test performance) prior to training, while after training, left-temporal function- and pseudoword evoked HFA varied with performance in tests of written language.', 'title Post-stroke language functions depend on the relative contributions of the dominant and non-dominant hemispheres. Thus, we aimed to identify the neural correlates of overt and covert verb generation in adult post-stroke aphasia. Sixteen aphasic LMCA stroke patients (SPs) and 32 healthy controls (HCs) underwent language testing followed by fMRI while performing an overt event-related verb generation task (ER-VGT) isolating activations related to noun-verb semantic processing or to articulation and auditory processing, and a covert block design verb generation task (BD-VGT). BD-VGT activation patterns were consistent with previous studies, while ER-VGT showed different patterns in SPs relative to HCs including less left-hemispheric involvement during semantic processing and predominantly right-sided activation related to articulation and auditory processing. ER-VGT intra-scanner performance was positively associated with activation during semantic associations in the left middle temporal gyrus for HCs (p=0.031) and left middle frontal gyrus for SPs (p=0.042). Increased activation in superior frontal/cingulate gyri was associated with better intra-scanner performance (p=0.020). Lesion size negatively impacted verbal fluency tested with Controlled Oral Word Association Test (p=0.0092) and the Semantic Fluency Test (p=0.033) and trended towards a negative association with verb generation performance on the event-related verb generation task (p=0.081).', 'title Patterns of language impairment have long been used clinically to localize brain damage in stroke patients.

The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate language lateralization in brain tumor patients using clinical language fMRI, comparing the results with a group of healthy volunteers. Fifty-seven strictly right-handed patients with left-hemispheric-space intracranial masses (mainly neoplastic) affecting either the Broca area (n = 19) or Wernicke area (n = 38) were prospectively enrolled in this study. Fourteen healthy volunteers served as a control group. Standardized clinical language fMRI, using visually triggered sentence- and word-generation paradigms, was performed on a 1.5T MR scanner. Semiautomated analyses of all functional data were conducted on an individual basis using BrainVoyager. A regional lateralization index was calculated for Broca and Wernicke areas separately versus their corresponding right-hemisphere homologs. In masses affecting the Broca area, a significant decrease in the lateralization index was found when performing word generation (P = .0017), whereas when applying sentence generation, the decrease did not reach statistical significance (P = .851). Masses affecting the Wernicke area induced a significant decrease of the lateralization index when performing sentence generation (P = .0007), whereas when applying word generation, the decrease was not statistically significant (P = .310).']"

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.', 'title Tumor cells can metastasize by entering existing vessels or new vessels actively recruited into the primary tumor. Invasion of the lymphatics and blood vessels in the periphery of the tumor seems to be a prerequisite step in the metastatic process. The aim of this study was to correlate peripheral lymphatic vessel infiltration (PLI) and peripheral blood vessel infiltration (PVI) in a cohort of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with various other prognostic parameters and outcome. The study population consisted of 236 female patients with invasive ductal breast carcinomas, who had been operated between 2011 and 2013. The registered data included age at diagnosis, histological subtype, tumor size, TNM stage, histological grade, estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), HER-2, p53, and PLI and PVI. Pathological examination revealed that 22.5% of the patients had PVI and 37.3% had PLI at the tumor front. PVI correlated with younger age (p<0.05), higher histologic grade (p<0.05), advanced TNM stage (p<0.05), higher T stage (p<0.05), higher N stage (p<0.05) and positive Ki67 expression (p<0.05). Similarly, PLI correlated with higher histologic grade (p<0.05), advanced TNM stage (p<0.05), higher T stage (p<0.05) and higher N stage (p<0.05). Statistical analysis did not reveal significant correlation between the presence of tumor blood and lymphatic vessels with infiltration in overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).', 'title Several reports suggest that the dissemination of neoplastic cells and cancer progression are associated with the generation of an immunosuppressive environment. In this report, we investigated immunological effects of prostate cancer by comparing metastastic and non-metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) from 25 patients with carcinomatous involvement of LNs to the non-metastatic LNs from 26 control patients with no metastatic involvement by immunohistochemistry and histological analyses. Our results showed a decreased abundance of CD20+ B lymphocytes (P = 0.031), CD38+ activated lymphocytes (P = 0.038), and CD68+ macrophages (P < 0.001), and less evidence of follicular hyperplasia (P = 0.014), sinus hyperplasia (P < 0.001), and fibrosis (P=0.028) in metastatic LNs comparatively to control LNs. Finally, we observed that metastatic LNs were significantly smaller than control LNs (P = 0.005).', 'title Crosstalk between a tumor and the microenvironment plays a key role in tumor progression and metastasis. This study was performed to elucidate the prognostic significance of combining tumor-secreted osteopontin (OPN) with microenvironment-associated peritumoral macrophages (PTMs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially for those with early-stage disease. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry was used to investigate OPN and PTMs expression in two independent cohorts consisting of 374 patients with HCC who underwent radical resection. The prognostic value for the two factors alone or in combination was investigated in these patients. OPN combined with PTMs was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS; p < 0.0001) and time to recurrence (TTR; p = 0.003) from the learning cohort (n = 96). Their combined value for prognosis was validated in early-stage HCCs using another independent cohort (n = 278; OS, p < 0.001; TTR, p = 0.001). This combination remained significant in HCCs with low α-fetoprotein levels in both cohorts, and was predictive for early recurrence/death risk (<2 years) compared with a single marker. Only OPN+HCCs had a significant correlation of PTMs levels with OS (p = 0.01) or TTR (p = 0.011).', 'title Because lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic invasion are key steps to nodal involvement in various types of cancer, we examined the clinicopathologic significance of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic invasion in renal cell carcinoma. Peritumoral lymphatics and intratumoral lymphatics (ITLs) from 106 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma specimens were immunostained with D2-40 antibody, which specifically recognizes the lymphatic-specific marker podoplanin. The clinicopathologic significance of the densities and presence of lymphatic vessels and lymphatic invasion (LVI) was evaluated, and the staining pattern of D2-40 was compared with that of CD34. Peritumoral lymphatics were present in 100 patients (94.3%), and ITLs were present in only 20 (18.9%). LVI was present in 6 patients (5.7%), of whom 5 had concomitant microvascular invasion. Some lymphatic vessels were positive not only for D2-40, but also for CD34. The presence of ITLs and LVI were significantly associated with pathologic T stage (P <0.0001 and P = 0.0136, respectively), regional lymph node involvement (P = 0.0312 and P = 0.0067, respectively), distant metastasis (P = 0.0046 and P = 0.0294, respectively), and microvascular invasion (P = 0.0105 and P = 0.0312, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that patients with ITLs had significantly shorter cancer-specific survival than those without ITLs (P = 0.0025) but multivariate analysis did not (P = 0.0527).', 'title Cancer lethality is usually the result of local invasion and metastasis of neoplastic cells from the primary tumor. Because of their ability to degrade extracellular matrix components (EMC), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the breakdown of basement membranes and underlying stroma, thereby facilitating tumor growth and invasion. The authors quantitated, by gelatin zymography and densitometric analysis, MMP activity in the euglobulin plasma fraction of 50 healthy controls and 91 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients (51 from the larynx and 40 from the oropharynx). The median value for 92-kilodalton (kD) MMP (MMP-9) activity was increased significantly in laryngeal (Md 2.1 arbitrary units (AU)/mL plasma; range, 0.2-6.4) and oropharyngeal patients (Md 2.08 AU/mL; range, 0.0-5.0) with respect to the controls (Md 0.48 AU/mL; range, 0.0-1.8). Both groups of cancer patients showed a similar behavior. Multivariate analysis indicated that circulating 92-kD MMP activity was not predicted by the clinical-pathologic parameters such as tumor stage, histologic grade, and metastatic lymph nodes. There was no association between high levels of MMP-9 activity and either cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption, major risk factors for developing HNSCC.', 'title Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes represent the host immune response to cancer. CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress the immune reaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinicopathologic significance and roles of Tregs and CD8+ T cells during hepatocarcinogenesis. We examined the infiltration of FOXP3+ Tregs and CD8+ T cells in the tumor stroma and nontumorous liver parenchyma using 323 hepatic nodules including precursor lesions, early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and advanced HCC, along with 39 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 59 metastatic liver adenocarcinomas. We did immunohistochemical comparative studies. The prevalence of Tregs was significantly higher in HCC than in the nontumorous liver (P<0.001). The patient group with a high prevalence of Tregs infiltrating HCC showed a significantly lower survival rate (P=0.007). Multivariate analysis revealed that the prevalence of Tregs infiltrating HCC was an independent prognostic factor. The prevalence of Tregs increased in a stepwise manner (P<0.001) and that of CD8+ T cells decreased during the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis (P<0.001). Regardless of the presence of hepatitis virus infection or histopathologic evidence of hepatitis, the prevalence of Tregs was significantly increased in nontumorous liver bearing primary hepatic tumors.', 'title Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are correlated with the prognosis of cancer patients. This study focuses on the association between the densities of tumor infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), activated CTL, regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) and Th17 lymphocytes, and the prognosis and clinicopathological features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Double immunohistochemical staining was performed in 106 biopsy specimens from newly diagnosed NPC patients. Prognostic values of infiltrating lymphocyte densities were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. The density of CD8+ TIL was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, while the density of Foxp3+ TIL was negatively associated with T stage (P < 0.05). For survival evaluation, the density of Foxp3+ TIL or Foxp3+ TIL combined with GrB+ TIL together was associated with better overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.01) in all patients and in the patients with late-stage diseases (Stages III and IV, P < 0.01). Meanwhile a low density of CD8+TIL or high ratio of FOXP3+TIL to CD8+TIL was correlated with better PFS in early stage patients (Stages I and II, P < 0.05). No significant association was found between IL-17+ TIL and clinicopathological characteristic or survival of NPC patients.']"

Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) have an important role in the treatment of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, by preventing apoptosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of different regimens of rhEPO in preventing apoptosis following I/R-induced hepatic injury. Isolated mouse livers were randomly divided into five groups: (1) control group, perfused for the whole study period (105 min); (2) 30-min perfusion followed by 90 min of ischemia and 15 min of reperfusion; (3), (4) and (5) like group 2, but with administration of rhEPO 5,000 units/kg i.p. at 30 min, 24 h, or both 30 min and 24 h respectively, before induction of ischemia. Perfusate liver enzyme levels and intrahepatic caspase-3 activity were measured, and apoptotic cells were identified by morphological criteria, TUNEL assay, and immunohistochemistry for caspase-3. Using immunoblot the expression of the proapoptotic JNK and inhibitor of NFkappaB (IkappaBalpha) were also evaluated. von Willebrand factor (vWF) immunohistochemistry was used as a marker of endothelial cells. Compared to the I/R livers, all 3 rhEPO pretreated groups showed: a significant reduction in liver enzyme levels (P < 0.05) and intrahepatic caspase-3 activity (P < 0.05), fewer apoptotic hepatocytes (P < 0.05) and positive vWF staining in numerous endothelial cells lining the sinusoids. EPO decreased JNK phosphorylation and the degradation of the inhibitor of NFkappaB (IkappaBalpha) during I/R. There was no added benefit of the multiple- over the single-dose rhEPO regimen.', 'title Previous studies have shown that addition of ethanol, iron, or arachidonic acid to HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 produced a loss in cell viability and caused apoptosis. These effects were enhanced when cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were lowered by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Overexpression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells could produce toxicity even in the absence of added toxin after BSO treatment. Studies were carried out to characterize this CYP2E1-and BSO-dependent toxicity. HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 were treated with BSO for 1 to 4 days, and various parameters associated with apoptosis and cell viability were assayed. Treatment of cells expressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells) with BSO resulted in apoptosis as well as necrosis. The apoptosis and necrosis were independent of each other. No toxicity was found with control HepG2 cells or HepG2 cells expressing CYP3A4 instead of CYP2E1 under these conditions. The antioxidant trolox partially prevented the apoptosis and necrosis, whereas diallylsulfide, a CYP2E1 inhibitor, was fully protective. The activity of caspase 3, but not caspases 1, 8, or 9, was increased in the BSO-treated E47 cells, and an inhibitor of caspase 3 prevented apoptosis. Damage to mitochondria appears to play a role in the CYP2E1- and BSO-dependent toxicity, because mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased and cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, prevented the apoptosis and the necrosis. The fall in membrane potential was prevented by trolox and diallylsulfide, suggesting damage to the mitochondria by CYP2E1-derived reactive oxygen species.', 'title Apoptosis is a stereotypical pathway of cell death that is orchestrated by a family of cysteine endoproteases called caspases. This study examined the effect of apoptosis inhibition with a specific caspase inhibitor on murine intestinal viability after ischemia-reperfusion (IR). C57Bl6 X SV129 mice underwent segmental small bowel ischemia by vascular isolation of 10 cm of terminal ileum. In separate experiments, the ischemic time was varied from 30 to 130 minutes with a reperfusion interval of 6 hours. The degree of small bowel injury was quantified from 1 to 5 (increasing severity) by standardized, blinded histologic grading. The degree of apoptosis was assessed with a specific assay (terminal deoxyamcleotydil transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling [TUNEL]) and quantified by calculating the apoptotic index (apoptotic cells/10 high-power fields). To evaluate for activation of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme we measured tissue mature interleukin-1beta levels using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To evaluate the effect of apoptosis inhibition on intestinal viability after IR, mice received 3.0 mg of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD (N-benzyloxycarbonyl Val-Ala-Asp-Ome-fluoromethylketone) subcutaneously before and after IR in five divided doses (n = 11), the same dose of ZFA (N-benzyloxycarbonyl Phe-Ala fluoromethylketone), a structurally similar molecule with no anticaspase activity (n = 9), or sham operation (n = 6). A linear relationship existed between ischemic interval and histologic grade (r = 0.69, P <.006). Increasing the ischemic interval from 0 to 50 minutes was associated with a fivefold increase in apoptotic index (P =.05). Ischemic bowel was measured to have an average of 57.3 +/- 7.8 pg/mL whereas normal bowel had an average of 1.8 +/- 0.5 pg/mL of mature interleukin-1beta present. Mice tolerated multiple injections of ZVAD and ZFA without signs of toxicity. Animals treated with ZVAD (apoptosis inhibitor) had little injury after 50 minutes of ischemia and 6 hours of reperfusion (injury grade 1.8) compared with sham controls (injury grade 1.2, P =.7) and had significantly less injury than mice treated with ZFA (placebo) (injury grade 3.0, P <.006).', 'title The role of C-Jun N-terminal Kinase (c-Jun Kinase) in apoptosis is unclear. It is likely that c-Jun Kinase activation is cell type and stimulus dependent. c-Jun Kinase promotes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mediated apoptosis in nuclear factor (NF)-KB deficient cells. Minimal NF-KB expression may be enough to abrogate c-Jun Kinase-mediated apoptosis during reperfusion injury. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hemorrhagic ischemia and reperfusion. Twenty experimental animals were treated with the NF-KB inhibitor herbimycin A, and 20 control animals underwent only hemorrhage and reperfusion. Serum TNF-alpha and c-Jun Kinase levels were measured. Adrenal, kidney, liver, ileum, colon, and skeletal muscle tissues were evaluated for apoptosis by hematoxylin and eosin staining. TNF-alpha levels were 400 pg/mL (control) and 385 pg/mL (experimental) during ischemia (p=0.46), increased in controls to 450 pg/mL, and decreased in the experimental arm to 175 pg/mL (p=0.028). c-Jun Kinase levels were 1,525 pg/mL (control) and 1,475 pg/mL (experimental) during ischemia (p=0.35) and increased to 5,250 pg/mL (control) and 5,000 pg/mL (experimental) after reperfusion (p=0.26). In control animals, necrosis was seen in kidney, adrenal, and liver specimens. Compared with controls, experimental animals had average tissue hemorrhage scores of less than 1 (p < 0.001), with no necrosis seen in any experimental arm (p<0.001).', 'title Mitochondrial membrane potential is essential for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation, and its abolition is an early event during apoptosis, a type of cell death commonly exhibited by tumor cells responding to treatment. Dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential can be specifically induced using the K+ ion channel-opening agent valinomycin and has been used in this study to determine how the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential could influence 18F-FDG incorporation. MCF-7 cells were treated with valinomycin for 30 min, inducing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as determined using flow cytometry with the JC-1 probe. 18F-FDG incorporation, the initial rate of O-methyl-D-glucose incorporation (a measure of glucose transport), hexokinase activity and subcellular distribution, ATP content using bioluminescence, and lactate production were determined on control and valinomycin-treated cells. A 30-min treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 micromol of valinomycin per liter resulted in absence of red fluorescence from JC-1, indicative of dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. 18F-FDG incorporation was significantly increased by 30 min of treatment with valinomycin and was still apparent after 3.5 h of incubation. Hexokinase activity and subcellular distribution were not significantly different between control cells and cells treated for 30 min with valinomycin. Glucose transport was moderately though significantly increased, and lactate production was also increased.', 'title To investigate the effects of K+ channel blockers on arsenic trioxide-induced HeLa cell death. Viability of HeLa cells was assessed by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using colorimetric MTT assay and the voltage-dependent K+ currents were recorded by using patch-clamp technique. Exposure of As2O3 (5 micromol x L(-1)) for 24 h caused marked HeLa cell death. The rest living cells after As2O3 24 h-incubation showed significant increase of K+ currents densities. At +80 mV, the densities of K+ currents (61 +/- 18) pA/10 pF (n = 8) in As2O3 24 h-incubation group were significantly more than that in the control group (38 +/- 10) pA/10 pF (n = 8, P < 0.05). The HeLa cells were prevented partially from As2O3-induced cell death by co-application for 24 h with typical voltage-dependent K+ channel blockers, 4-aminopyridine (3 mmol x L(-1)) or tetraethylammonium (5 mmol x L(-1)). 4-Aminopyridine (3 mmol x L(-1)) or tetraethylammonium (5 mmol x L(-1)) did not show any toxic effects on HeLa cells.', 'title The purpose of this study was to test whether mitochondrial dysfunction is causative of sepsis sequelae, a mouse model of peritonitis sepsis induced by cecal ligation and perforation. Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition was achieved by means of pharmacological drugs and overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell leukemia (Bcl)-2. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients and the predominant cause of multiple organ failure. Although precise mechanisms by which sepsis leads to multiple organ dysfunction are unknown, growing evidence suggests that perturbations of key mitochondrial functions, including adenosine triphosphate production, Ca2+ homeostasis, oxygen-derived free radical production, and permeability transition, might be involved in sepsis pathophysiology. Heart and lung functions were evaluated respectively by means of isolated heart preparation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration, lung wet/dry weight ratio, lung homogenate myeloperoxidase activity, and histopathologic grading. Respiratory fluxes, calcium uptake, and membrane potential were evaluated in isolated heart mitochondria. Peritonitis sepsis induced multiple organ dysfunction, mitochondrial abnormalities, and increased mortality rate, which were reduced by pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial transition by cyclosporine derivatives and mitochondrial Bcl-2 overexpression.', 'title To evaluate the potential role of reactive oxygen metabolites as signals for endothelial cell apoptosis. A series of antioxidants were evaluated for their ability to block apoptosis in cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells in vitro. Scavenging of the hydroxyl radical with the membrane-permeable scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide or blocking its generation via the Fenton reaction by the chelation of iron with o-phenanthroline blocked apoptosis, whereas the cell membrane-impermeable scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase did not block apoptosis. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase with enzyme-inhibitory levels of allopurinol also failed to block apoptosis, whereas high levels of allopurinol, which also scavenge the hydroxyl radical in vitro, conferred protection. In each case (dimethyl sulfoxide, o-phenanthroline, and high-dose allopurinol), hydroxyl radical ablation was only effective when administered before the priming step (lipopolysaccharide) and was ineffective when administered later, prior to the activation step (heat shock).', \"title Isoflurane induces cell apoptosis by an unknown mechanism. The authors hypothesized that isoflurane activates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, causing excessive calcium release, triggering apoptosis. The authors determined isoflurane-induced cytotoxicity by measuring caspase-3 activity, lactate dehydrogenase release, MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) reduction, and imaging analysis of cell damage markers (annexin V and propidium iodide staining) in different cell types. The authors used the chicken B lymphocyte with a total knock-out of IP3 receptors, PC12 cells with elevated IP3 receptor activity (transfected with L286V presenilin 1), striatal cells with a knock-in of Q111 Huntingtin, and each cell line's corresponding wild-type controls. The authors also measured the isoflurane-evoked changes of calcium concentration in cytosol and/or mitochondria in these cells. Isoflurane induced apoptosis concentration- and time-dependently, and sequentially elevated cytosolic and then mitochondrial calcium in the chicken B-lymphocyte wild-type but not the IP3 receptor total knock-out cells. Thapsigargin, a calcium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor on ER membranes, induced apoptosis and elevations of calcium in cytosol and mitochondria in both chicken B-lymphocyte wild-type and IP3 receptor total knock-out cells. Isoflurane induced significantly more neurotoxicity and greater calcium release from the ER in L286V PC12 and Q111 Huntingtin striatal cells than in their corresponding wild-type controls, both of which were significantly inhibited by the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C.\", 'title The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is an important factor for apoptosis, and it is produced by the proton electrochemical gradient (ΔµH(+)). Therefore, the intracellular proton concentration (pH(in)) is an important factor for modifying the ΔΨm. However, the effects of lidocaine on pH(in) are unclear. To investigate mitochondrial responses to lidocaine, therefore, we simultaneously measured pH(in) with ΔΨm, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence, and calculated the FAD/NADH ratio (redox ratio), the superoxide production in mitochondria. Morphological change and early apoptosis were observed by annexin-V FITC staining under fluorescent microscope. The ratiometric fluorescent probe JC-1 and HPTS were used for the simultaneous measurements of ΔΨm with pH(in) in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. FAD and NADH autofluorescence were simultaneously measured, and the FAD/NADH fluorescence ratio (redox ratio) was calculated. The superoxide was measured by mitosox-red fluorescent probe for mitochondrial superoxide. Lidocaine was evaluated at 1, 5, and 10\\xa0mM. Morphological change and early apoptosis were observed after 10\\xa0mM lidocaine administration. Lidocaine depolarized ΔΨm with increased pH(in) in a dose-dependent manner. In low-pH saline (pH 6), in the presence of both the weak acids (acetate and propionate), lidocaine failed to depolarize ΔΨm and increase pH(in). On the other hand, lidocaine decreased the redox ratio in the cell and increased the levels of superoxide in a dose-dependent manner.']"

         "['title The relationships between endogenous sex hormone levels and cardiovascular disease risk in women are contentious. Our aim was to systematically investigate the relationships between sex steroids and lipid levels in postmenopausal women, taking into account other potential risk factors. This is a cross-sectional study of 624 naturally and surgically postmenopausal women not using any systemic hormones or lipid-lowering therapy, with a mean (SD) age of 53.9 (5.8) years, who were recruited in the United States, Canada, Australia, UK, and Sweden between July 2004 and February 2005. The relationships between total testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and each lipid variable were explored using multivariable linear regression. None of the sex steroids measured made an independent contribution to the multivariable models for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides (TG). The best model for total cholesterol included race and age, and that for LDL cholesterol included race and blood pressure, with each model only explaining 4.8% and 3.3% of the variation in each lipid, respectively. About 7.7% of the variation in non-HDL cholesterol was explained by HOMA-IR, race, and SHBG. HOMA-IR, SHBG, age, and surgical menopause explained 22.8% of the variation in HDL cholesterol, whereas HOMA-IR, SHBG, race, and surgical menopause explained 25.4% of the variation in TG.', 'title Men have a higher stroke incidence compared to women until advanced age. The contribution of hormones to these sex differences has been extensively debated. In experimental stroke, estradiol is neuroprotective, whereas androgens are detrimental. However, prior studies have only examined the effects of acute treatment paradigms; therefore, the timing and mechanism by which ischemic sexual dimorphism arises are unknown. The effects of exogenous neonatal androgen exposure on subsequent injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adulthood in male rats were examined. Rats were administered vehicle (oil), testosterone propionate (TP) or the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 5 days after birth. At 3 months of age, a focal stroke was induced. Testosterone-treated rats (but not DHT-treated animals) had decreased infarct volumes (20 vs. 33%, p < 0.05) as well as increased estradiol levels (39.4 vs. 18.6 pg/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oil-treated animals. TP-injected males had increased testicular aromatase (P450arom) levels (3.6 vs. 0.2 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oil-treated males. The level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspase-induced apoptosis, was increased in TP-treated rats compared with the oil-treated males.', 'title Men and postmenopausal women exhibit a higher risk for atherosclerosis than premenopausal women. These differences were often attributed to sex steroids, but the role of estrogen and testosterone in atherosclerosis are more complex than anticipated. Cross-sex hormone therapy of transsexuals is an interesting model, which has been used to study hormonal effects on serum lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body composition. However, studies on macrophage cholesterol efflux, the first step in reverse cholesterol transport, are not available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cross-sex hormone therapy in transsexuals on the capacity of serum to accept cholesterol from macrophages. Cholesterol acceptor capacity (CAC) of serum from transsexuals before and after at least 6 months of hormone treatment was measured using macrophage tissue culture models. CAC of serum using the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells). Unexpectedly, the CAC of serum from male to female (MtF) transsexuals was not increased, but decreased after hormone therapy. Serum from female to male (FtM) transsexuals showed no changes in CAC.', 'title Women are more affected than men by many chronic pain conditions, suggesting the effect of sex-related mechanisms in their occurrence. The role of gonadal hormones has been studied but with contrasting results depending on the pain syndrome, reproductive status, and hormone considered. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pain changes related to the menopausal transition period. In this observational study, postmenopausal women were asked to evaluate the presence of pain in their life during the premenopausal and postmenopausal periods and its modification with menopause. One hundred one women were enrolled and completed questionnaires on their sociodemographic status, pain characteristics, and evolution. The most common pain syndromes were headache (38%), osteoarticular pain (31%), and cervical/lumbar pain (21%). Pain was present before menopause in 66 women, ceased with menopause in 17, and started after menopause in 18. Data were used for cluster analysis, which allowed the division of participants into four groups. In the first, all women experienced headaches that disappeared or improved with menopause. The second group included osteoarticular pain; the pain improved in half of these women and remained stable in the other half. The third group had cervical/lumbar pain, which disappeared or improved with menopause in all. The fourth group presented different kinds of moderate pain, which worsened in all.', 'title Sex influences the cardiorenal risk associated with body mass index (BMI). The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in adiposity-mediated cardiorenal risk profiles in healthy, non-obese men and women was investigated. Systemic and renal hemodynamic responses to angiotensin-II (AngII) as a function of BMI, waist and hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, as well as fat and lean mass were measured in 18 men and 25 women in high-salt balance, stratified by BMI (<25 kg/m2 (ideal body weight (IBW)) vs. ≥25 kg/m2 overweight)). In men (n\\u2009=\\u20097, BMI 23\\u2009±\\u20091 kg/m2) and women (n\\u2009=\\u200914, BMI 22\\u2009±\\u20092 kg/m2) of IBW, BMI was not associated with the systolic blood pressure (SBP) response to AngII. In contrast, overweight men (n\\u2009=\\u200911, 29\\u2009±\\u20092 kg/m2) demonstrated a progressively more blunted vasoconstrictor SBP response to AngII challenge as BMI increased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.007), even after adjustment for covariates. Women maintained the same relationship between BMI and the SBP response to AngII irrespective of weight status (P\\u2009=\\u20090.2, IBW vs. overweight women). Compared to BMI, other adiposity measures showed similar associations to systemic AngII responsiveness in men but not in women. Increasing BMI was associated with a blunted renovasoconstrictor response to AngII in all subjects, but was more pronounced in men.', 'title Sex differences in lipid metabolism result in a less proatherogenic plasma lipid profile in premenopausal women than men. The mechanisms responsible for this are unclear but are thought to be related to differences in the sex hormone milieu in men and women. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of endogenous sex hormones on very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride (TG) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured basal VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB-100 concentrations and kinetics by using stable isotope-labeled tracers. Eight premenopausal women [age, 43 + or - 8 yr; body mass index (BMI), 35 + or - 4 kg/m(2); mean + or - sd], eight postmenopausal women (age, 55 + or - 4 yr; BMI, 34 + or - 4 kg/m(2)), and eight men (age, 41 + or - 13 yr; BMI, 34 + or - 4 kg/m(2)) were studied at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO. VLDL-TG secretion rate was approximately double (P < 0.05) in postmenopausal women and men compared with premenopausal women but not different in postmenopausal women and men. The secretion rate of VLDL-apoB-100 was not different in pre- and postmenopausal women but was greater (P < 0.05) in men than in women.', 'title In women, sex hormones cause increased morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and adversely affect the coagulation profile. We have studied the effect of physiological testosterone replacement therapy in men on coagulation factor expression, to determine if there is an increased risk of thrombosis. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of testosterone in 46 men with chronic stable angina. Measurements of free, total and bioavailable testosterone, luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and full blood count were made at 0, 6 and 14 weeks. Bioavailable testosterone levels were: 2.58 +/- 0.58 nmol/l at baseline, compared with 3.35 +/- 0.31 nmol/l at week 14 (P < 0.001) after treatment compared with 2.6 +/- 0.18 nmol/l and 2.44 +/- 0.18 nmol/l in the placebo group (P was not significant). There was no change in fibrinogen (3.03 +/- 0.18 g/l at baseline and 3.02 +/- 0.18 g/l at week 14, P = 0.24), tPA activity (26.77 +/- 4.9 Iu/ml and 25.67 +/- 4.4 Iu/ml, P = 0.88) or PAI-1 activity (0.49 +/- 0.85 Iu/ml and 0.36 +/- 0.06 Iu/ml, P = 0.16) with active treatment and no differences between the groups (at week 14, P value 0.98, 0.59 and 0.8 for fibrinogen, PAI-1 and tPA respectively). Haemoglobin concentration did not change over time, in the testosterone group (1.44 +/- 0.02 g/l and 1.45 +/- 0.02 g/l, P = 0.22).', 'title Men have high cardiovascular risk and unfavourable cardiac autonomic tone compared to premenopausal women. The role of sex hormones in control of autonomic tone is unclear. We sought to determine the association between sex hormones and cardiosympathovagal tone at baseline and in response to a physiological stressor. Forty-eight healthy subjects (21 men, 27 premenopausal women) were studied in high-salt balance. Cardiac autonomic tone was assessed by heart rate variability, calculated by spectral power analysis (low frequency (LF, a measure of sympathetic modulation), high frequency (HF, a measure of vagal modulation) and LF:HF (a measure of cardiosympathovagal balance)) at baseline and in response to graded Angiotensin II (AngII) infusion (3 ng/kg/min × 30 min, 6 ng/kg/min × 30 min) were measured. The primary outcome was association between endogenous sex hormone levels and measures of cardiac autonomic tone. All subjects had sex hormone levels in the normal range. No associations were observed between sex hormones and baseline cardiac autonomic tone in men or women. Men with lower testosterone levels, however, were unable to maintain both cardiosympathetic (p = 0.045) and cardiovagal tone (p = 0.035) in response to AngII even after adjustments for covariates. No association was observed between estradiol and progesterone and cardiac autonomic response to AngII in either sex.', 'title To assess the vascular effects of high-dose androgen treatment in genetic females. Male gender is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, suggesting either a protective effect of estrogens and/or a deleterious effect of androgens. We have recently demonstrated that androgen deprivation is associated with enhanced vascular reactivity in adult men, however, the effects of androgen excess on vascular function in humans has not been reported previously. We studied vascular reactivity in two groups of genetic females: 12 female-to-male transsexuals receiving long-term high-dose androgens, and 12 healthy female control subjects, matched for age and smoking history. Using external vascular ultrasound, brachial artery diameter was measured at rest, after flow increase (leading to flow-mediated dilatation [FMD], which depends on normal endothelial function) and after sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG), an endothelium-independent dilator. Testosterone levels were higher (15.2+/-8.7 vs. 1.9+/-1.3 mmol/L, p < 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower (1.2+/-0.2 vs. 1.6+/-0.4 mmol/L, p=0.02) in the transsexuals compared with the control subjects. In each group, nine of 12 subjects were current or ex-smokers, leading to impaired FMD in both groups (5.1+/-3.7% in the transsexuals vs. 6.9+/-4.1% in controls, p=0.28). The NTG response was significantly decreased in the transsexuals (15.9+/-4.9% vs. 22+/-5.8% in controls, p=0.01), independent of the effects of age, cholesterol or vessel size.', 'title Oestrogen is known to play a cardioprotective role in cardiovascular diseases, as demonstrated in a number of animal studies. However, few human studies have investigated sex-based differences with regard to cardiac glucose uptake using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Therefore, we evaluated healthy male and female subjects who underwent FDG-PET/CT examination to determine whether there was a sex-related difference in cardiac glucose uptake with age. In females, the prevalence of maximal FDG uptake (PET score 2) demonstrated a convex pattern with ageing, and it peaked at age 51-60 years in the females, gradually decreasing to a minimum at age >70 years. In contrast, the prevalence of maximal FDG uptake by age in males was a mirror image of that in females, i.e. it formed a concave pattern with a nadir at 61-70 years, followed by an increase in the prevalence. These findings suggest that female hearts depend more on glucose as an energy substrate as they age, however, efficient glucose uptake is attenuated with increasing age. In contrast, the male heart sustains its glucose uptake capacity at age >70 years.']"

         "['title Although increasing evidence indicates that serotonin (SER; 5-hydroxytrypamine [5-HT]) is involved in the regulation of bone metabolism, conflicting data exist regarding whether SER promotes or inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Regeneration of functional bone is required for proper osseointegration of dental implants. Noticeably, the use of selective SER reuptake inhibitors was recently associated with the failure of osseointegrated dental implants. The present study examines the direct role of peripheral SER on the regulation of bone regeneration. The effect of SER on osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration was examined using rat calvarial cell cultures in vitro and a rat critical-sized calvarial defect model in vivo. Rat calvarial cells expressed SER receptors Htr1 (5-HT1) and Htr2 (5-HT2), which are known to transmit signals in bone cells. In vitro, SER significantly reduced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of rat calvarial cells with concomitant reduction of osteoblast marker genes including alkaline phosphatase (Alpl), osterix (Sp7), and osteocalcin (Bglap). Histologic and radiologic analyses using the rat critical-sized calvarial defect model revealed that the existence of SER significantly inhibited β-phase tricalcium phosphate-induced bone regeneration.', 'title Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) promotes osteoclast differentiation from monocyte precursors by inducing a cohort of genes, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). A family of synthetic triterpenoids with antiinflammatory and pro-apoptotic properties was described to modulate differentiation in monocytic cell lineages. We therefore investigated the ability of the potent and bioavailable synthetic triterpenoid TP-222 to inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and MMP-9 expression from monocytic precursor cells. Osteoclast formation was assayed by staining for TRAP-positive multinucleated cells. MMP-9 expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and gel zymography. In vivo effects of TP-222 were assessed by daily intraperitoneal injection of 4-week-old mice for 7 days followed by measurement of osteoclast number and MMP-9 expression at the cartilage/bone junction of the epiphyseal growth plate. RANKL promoted and TP-222 (300 nM) inhibited osteoclast formation in cultures of RAW264.7 cells or bone marrow-derived monocytes. RANKL also induced MMP-9 expression in RAW264.7 cells and this was reduced by concurrent or subsequent addition of TP-222. TP-222 treatment significantly reduced the mean number of osteoclasts present at the cartilage/bone interface compared to vehicle-injected control mice. Morphometric analyses of tissue sections showed that TP-222 treatment reduced the amount of immunoreactive MMP-9 present in both mononucleated pre-osteoclasts and osteoclasts.', 'title To explore the molecular mechanisms of C/EBPα for regulating the osteogenesis of C3H10T1/2 cells. We constructed an in vitro osteogenic differentiation model and investigated the mRNA and protein expression profile of PPARγ2 during C3H10T1/2 osteogenesis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Next we constructed an adenovirus vector loading siRNA against PPARγ2 and employed a specific antagonist of PPARγ, G3335, to examine the effect of PPARγ on activating the expression of C/EBPα. Then we performed ChIP to test PPARγ2 binding on -1 286 bp/-1 065 bp region of C/EBPα promoter and explore the role of PPARγ in the dependence of histone hypoacetylation on DNA methylation in -1 286 bp/-1 065 bp region of C/EBPα promoter. During the osteogenic differentiation, PPARγ mRNA and protein expression initially increased and then decreased in double-phase reactions. siRNA and G3335 induced down-regulation of PPARγ activity inhibited C/EBPα in C3H10T1/2 cells up-regulation of osteogenic differentiation. ChIP results show that DNA methylation could weaken the binding section PPARγ2 to -1 286 bp/-1 065 bp capabilities.', 'title The molecular mechanisms that regulate hADSC differentiation toward osteogenic precursors and subsequent bone-forming osteoblasts is unknown. Using osteoblast precursors obtained from subcutaneous human adipose tissue, we observed that microRNA-26a modulated late osteoblasts differentiation by targeting the SMAD1 transcription factor. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms guiding human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hADSCs) differentiation is of extreme importance for improving the treatment of bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to identify microRNA as a regulator of the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. Osteoblast differentiation of hADSCs was induced by treatment with dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerol phosphate. The expression of osteoblastic phenotype was evaluated after the induction by simultaneous monitoring of alkaline phosphatase activity, the expression of genes involved in osteoblastic differentiation by real-time RT-PCR, and mineralization at the same time. MicroRNA expression was determined by Northern blot, and transfection of both antisense miR-RNA and sensor plasmids was done to validate the inhibitory role of microRNA during hADSC osteogenesis. Western blot was used to determine the expression levels of the SMAD1 protein. qRT-PCR analysis was used to compare the expression patterns of osteoblastic markers in transfected cells.', 'title To investigate the effects of leptin on the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts induced by soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (sRANKL) and its possible mechanism. The effects of leptin on the differentiation from osteoclast precursor cells into osteoclasts were detected by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The mRNA expressions of TRAP and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in osteoclast precursor cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The protein expressions of TRAP and PPARγ were detected by Western blotting. Compared with sRANKL treatment group, the differentiation from osteoclast precursor cells into osteoclasts was significantly inhibited in sRANKL combined with leptin treatment groups. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expressions of both TRAP and PPARγ significantly decreased in sRANKL combined with leptin treatment groups compared with the sRANKL treatment alone. Furthermore, the expression of PPARγ was reduced in a dose-dependent manner.', 'title We showed that the IGF-IR-null mutation in mature osteoblasts leads to less bone and decreased periosteal bone formation and impaired the stimulatory effects of PTH on osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. This study was carried out to examine the role of IGF-I signaling in mediating the actions of PTH on bone. Three-month-old mice with an osteoblast-specific IGF-I receptor null mutation (IGF-IR OBKO) and their normal littermates were treated with vehicle or PTH (80 microg/kg body weight/d for 2 wk). Structural measurements of the proximal and midshaft of the tibia were made by microCT. Trabecular and cortical bone formation was measured by bone histomorphometry. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were obtained to assess the effects of PTH on osteoprogenitor number and differentiation. The fat-free weight of bone normalized to body weight (FFW/BW), bone volume (BV/TV), and cortical thickness (C.Th) in both proximal tibia and shaft were all less in the IGF-IR OBKO mice compared with controls. PTH decreased FFW/BW of the proximal tibia more substantially in controls than in IGF-IR OBKO mice. The increase in C.Th after PTH in the proximal tibia was comparable in both control and IGF-IR OBKO mice. Although trabecular and periosteal bone formation was markedly lower in the IGF-IR OBKO mice than in the control mice, endosteal bone formation was comparable in control and IGF-IR OBKO mice. PTH stimulated endosteal bone formation only in the control animals. Compared with BMSCs from control mice, BMSCs from IGF-IR OBKO mice showed equal alkaline phosphatase (ALP)(+) colonies on day 14, but fewer mineralized nodules on day 28. Administration of PTH increased the number of ALP(+) colonies and mineralized nodules on days 14 and 28 in BMSCs from control mice, but not in BMSCs from IGF-IR OBKO mice.', 'title The relationship of circulating levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) with the expression of these molecules in bone has not been established. The objective of this study was to measure, in humans, the serum levels of RANKL and OPG, and the corresponding levels in bone of mRNA encoding these proteins. Fasting blood samples were obtained on the day of surgery from patients presenting for hip replacement surgery for primary osteoarthritis (OA). Intraoperatively, samples of intertrochanteric trabecular bone were collected for analysis of OPG and RANKL mRNA, using real time RT-PCR. Samples were obtained from 40 patients (15 men with age range 50 to 79 years, and 25 women with age range 47 to 87 years). Serum total RANKL and free OPG levels were measured using ELISA. Serum OPG levels increased over the age range of this cohort. In the men RANKL mRNA levels were positively related to age, whereas serum RANKL levels were negatively related to age. Again, in the men serum RANKL levels were inversely related (r = -0.70, P = 0.007) to RANKL mRNA levels. Also in the male group, RANKL mRNA levels were associated with a number of indices of bone structure (bone volume fraction relative to bone tissue volume, specific surface of bone relative to bone tissue volume, and trabecular thickness), bone remodelling (eroded surface and osteoid surface), and biochemical markers of bone turnover (serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary deoxypyridinoline).', 'title Wnt/β-catenin (cWnt) signaling plays a key role in osteogenesis by promoting the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, activities altered in human osteoarthritic subchondral osteoblast (OA Ob). Sclerostin (SOST) has been shown to alter cWnt signaling. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) acts as a novel bone regulator and represses SOST levels in Ob. However the role of SIRT1 and SOST in OA Ob remains unknown. Herein, we explored the role played by SIRT1 and SOST on the abnormal mineralization and cWnt signaling in OA Ob. Primary human normal and OA Ob were prepared from tibial plateaus. SOST levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, the expression and production of genes by qRT-PCR and WB analysis. Their inhibitions were performed using siRNA. cWnt signaling was measured by the TOPflash TCF/lef luciferase reporter assay. Mineralization was determined by alizarin red staining. SOST levels were significantly increased in OA Ob compared to normal and were linked with elevated TGF-β1 levels in these cells. SIRT1 expression was significantly reduced in OA Ob compared to normal yet not modified by TGF-β1. Specific inhibition of SIRT1 increased TGF-β1 and SOST expressions in OA Ob, while stimulating SIRT1 activity with β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide reduced the expression of TGF-β1 and SOST, and increased mineralization in OA Ob. Resveratrol also reduced SOST expression in OA Ob. Reduced cWnt signaling, β-catenin levels, and mineralization in OA Ob were all corrected via reducing SOST expression.', 'title [Ca2+]e may be important in bone turnover.

Local changes in extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]e) may play an important role in bone turnover. We examined the possibility that prostaglandins produced by cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) could mediate some of the effects of [Ca2+]e on osteoblasts. We examined the [Ca2+]e induction of COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in primary osteoblasts (POBs) obtained by sequential enzymatic digestion of mouse calvariae. We measured mRNA and protein levels by Northern and Western analyses and PGE2 production in culture medium by radioimmunoassay (RIA). COX-2 promoter activity was measured as luciferase activity in calvarial osteoblasts derived from mice transgenic for 371 bp of the COX-2 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene.', 'title This study aimed to explore the effect of the up-regulation of Notch1 on osteoclastogenesis induced to osteoclasts by receptor activator for nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factors (MCSF) in vitro.

Osteoclast formation was analyzed by TRAP assay. The number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells of the experimental group significantly decreased compared with that of the control group. The mRNA expression levels of Notch1, Notch3, Jagged1, Delta3, and Hesl of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group, whereas the TRAP mRNA expression of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05).']"

The AURKA, BRCA1, CCNE1 and CDK2 genes play pivotal roles in centrosome duplication and cell-cycle regulation. Using a haplotype-based analysis, this study aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in these four genes may contribute to ovarian cancer susceptibility. A total of 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these four genes were genotyped in 287 cases of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas and 618 age-matched cancer-free controls from the Chinese Han population, and then haplotype blocks were reconstructed according to our genotyping data and linkage disequilibrium (LD) status of these SNPs. For AURKA, we found that haplotype GA [rs6064391 (T→G)+rs911162 (G→A)] was strongly associated with decreased ovarian cancer risk (adjusted OR=0.31, 95% CI=0.15-0.63, P=0.0012). For BRCA1, we found that haplotype CGTAG was associated with decreased ovarian cancer risk (adjusted OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.41-0.98, P=0.0417). Moreover, women harboring homozygous GA/CGTAG haplotypes showed the lowest risk (OR=0.12, 95% CI=0.02-0.94, P=0.0438). In CCNE1, the SNPs rs3218035 and rs3218042 were significantly associated with increased ovarian cancer risk (rs3218035: adjusted OR=5.20, 95% CI=1.85-14.52, P=0.0017; rs3218042: adjusted OR=4.98, 95% CI=1.75-14.19, P=0.0027). For CDK2, no significant association was found.', 'title To investigate the association of uPA system genes, including uPA, uPA receptor (uPAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 gene polymorphisms, with risk of endometrial cancer. In the present case control study, we enrolled a total of 134 patients with endometrial cancer confirmed by histopathology and 302 unrelated healthy individuals. Genetic polymorphisms of uPA system genes, including uPA rs4065 C/T SNP, uPAR rs344781 T/C SNP, and PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/5G SNP were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) genotyping analysis. Frequency of PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype and 4G allele differed significantly between patients with endometrial cancer (36.6% and 61.6%, respectively) and healthy individuals (25.5% and 52.2%, respectively). Individuals with PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype were at higher risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.20-4.27). Stratification analysis showed individuals with PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype were at elevated risk for endometrioid type (OR = 2.49; 95% CI 1.27-4.88), low stage (stages I-II) endometrial cancer (OR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.21-4.52). However, no significant differences in uPA C/T SNP, uPAR T/C SNP genotypes were observed between endometrial carcinoma cases and controls.', 'title Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far reported 12 loci associated with serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. We hypothesized that some of these loci function through nearby transcription factor (TF) genes and that putative target genes of these TFs as identified by coexpression may also be enriched for additional EOC risk associations. We selected TF genes within 1 Mb of the top signal at the 12 genome-wide significant risk loci. Mutual information, a form of correlation, was used to build networks of genes strongly coexpressed with each selected TF gene in the unified microarray dataset of 489 serous EOC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Genes represented in this dataset were subsequently ranked using a gene-level test based on results for germline SNPs from a serous EOC GWAS meta-analysis (2,196 cases/4,396 controls). Gene set enrichment analysis identified six networks centered on TF genes (HOXB2, HOXB5, HOXB6, HOXB7 at 17q21.32 and HOXD1, HOXD3 at 2q31) that were significantly enriched for genes from the risk-associated end of the ranked list (P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05). These results were replicated (P < 0.05) using an independent association study (7,035 cases/21,693 controls). Genes underlying enrichment in the six networks were pooled into a combined network.', 'title A recent ovarian cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a locus on 9p22 associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers localize to the BNC2 gene, which has been associated with ovarian development. We analyzed the association of 9p22 SNPs with transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) screening results and CA-125 blood levels from participants without ovarian cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO); 1,106 women with adequate ultrasound screening results and available genotyping information were included in the study. We observed a significantly increased risk of abnormal suspicious TVU results for seven SNPs on 9p22, with odds ratios between 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04-2.72) for rs4961501 and 2.10 (95% CI: 1.31-3.38) for rs12379183. Associations were restricted to abnormal suspicious findings at the first TVU screen. We did not observe an association between 9p22 SNPs and CA-125 levels.', 'title The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that p53 mutations are less frequent in ovarian cancers with alterations in other genes that regulate G1 progression. Expression of G1 stimulatory (cyclins D1 and E, cdk4, Ki67) and inhibitory (p16, Rb, p27, p14) genes was analyzed using Western blots in 84 primary ovarian cancers and seven cell lines of known p53 mutation status. Expression of p16 and Rb also was determined using immunohistochemistry and the p16 gene was examined for homozygous deletions and mutations. Loss of p16 protein was more frequent in ovarian cancers with wild-type p53. All four cell lines with wild-type p53 had lost p16 compared to only one of three with mutant p53 genes. p16 expression was absent in 34% (28/82) of primary ovarian cancers, and this was significantly more common in cases with wild-type p53 (14/28, 50%) compared to those with p53 mutations (14/54, 26%, P = 0.03). Homozygous deletion of the p16 gene was found in cell lines lacking p16, but not in any primary cancers. p16 loss was more common in serous (21/52, 40%) than nonserous cancers (4/23, 17%, P = 0.07). Cases that expressed p16 were more likely to express high levels of Rb (47/55, 85%) than p16-negative cases (12/28, 43%, P < 0.001). Loss of Rb occurred in 5/30 (17%) ovarian cancers lacking p53 mutations compared to 5/54 (9%) cases with p53 mutations (P = 0.48). Expression of G1 stimulatory proteins (cyclins D1 and E, cdk4, Ki67) did not correlate with p53 mutation status.', 'title Overexpression of mitotic kinases has been associated with prognosis, histologic grade, and clinical stage in ovarian cancer, but the relationship between inherited variation in these genes and ovarian cancer risk has not been well defined. We measured associations between 397 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 67 mitotic kinases and invasive epithelial ovarian cancer risk in two case-control studies (n = 671 cases; n = 939 controls). Thirty-six candidate SNPs (P < 0.05) were assessed in a replication analysis consisting of three additional studies (n = 1,094 cases; n = 829 controls). In initial analysis, thirty-six SNPs were suggestive of association with risk of serous ovarian cancer, all subtypes of ovarian cancer, or both (P < 0.05). Replication analyses suggested an association between rs2125846 in the Nemo-like kinase (NLK) gene and ovarian cancer (serous OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11-1.67, P = 1.77 × 10(-3); all subtypes OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08-1.56, P = 2.97 × 10(-3)). Furthermore, rs2125846 was associated with risk in the combined discovery and replication sets (serous OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.15-1.54; all subtypes OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.12-1.45).', \"title The enzyme matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 is involved in ovarian carcinogenesis. A common guanine insertion-deletion promoter polymorphism within the gene encoding MMP-1 (MMP1) has been suggested to be a candidate gene for ovarian cancer.

The MMP1 promoter polymorphism was examined in 151 Caucasian patients with epithelial ovarian cancer using polymerase chain reaction. Results were correlated with clinical data. No associations were ascertained between the MMP1 polymorphism and tumor stage (P = 1.0, odds ratio [OR] 1.08), lymph node involvement (P = 1.0, OR 0.8), tumor grading (P = 0.2, OR 0.5), and patient's age at diagnosis (P = 1.0, OR 1.04). Besides the clinically established prognosticators, tumor stage and histological grade, presence of the MMP1 polymorphism was associated with a shortened disease-free and overall survival in a univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.01) and a multivariate Cox regression model (P = 0.04).\", 'title To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in p21 and p27 genes with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

The gene L1C was screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which could impact upon EOC risk or disease progression. Overlapping DNA fragments, including the promoter region, intron 1 and all the exons of 10 healthy volunteers were analyzed to detect SNPs. EOC patients (n=103) and age-matched controls (n=104) were subsequently genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to detect potential associations of SNPs with L1C mRNA expression. One SNP was found in intron 1 (L1C G842A). Genotyping of the EOC patients and age-matched controls revealed an association of EOC with the homozygous AA genotype (OR 7.4, CI 1.6-33.5; p=0.003). The L1C mRNA expression levels and clinical parameters did not differ significantly between the L1C G842A genotypes.', 'title Deletions and point mutations of the p16 gene are detectable in more than 50% of ovarian cancer cells. In this study, we examined the effect of p16 gene transduction on the growth of ovarian cancer cells and on the effect of anti-cancer agents. p16-null human ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV-3 and OVCAR-5, were used in this study. We transduced the full-length human p16 gene using recombinant adenovirus (AxCA-hp16). The spontaneous growth of these cells was significantly inhibited by hp16 transduction. MTT assay revealed that AxCA-hp16 infection induced chemoresistance in both cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that only hp16 -transduced SKOV-3, were arrested at the G1-phase for 3 days whereas those infected with AxCA-mock and OVCAR-5 infected with both recombinant viruses did not. Western blot analysis showed increased microtubule-associated proteins 4 (MAP4) in both cell lines.']"

Literature search via PubMed and MEDLINE, going back to 1990. Academically affiliated private fertility center. Mothers and offspring in singleton and twin pregnancies. None. Maternal and perinatal/neonatal risks as well as cost considerations for singleton versus twin pregnancies. Most risk assessments of twin pregnancies after fertility treatment have used spontaneous conceptions data, which reflect different treatment paradigms and outcome benefits from pregnancies after fertility treatments. In vitro fertilization (IVF) twins demonstrate approximately 40% lower outcome risks than spontaneous twin conceptions. Most risk assessments in the literature are calculated with pregnancy as the primary outcome, but in a fertility-treatment paradigm where patients want more than one child the statistically correct risk assessment should refer to born children as the primary reference. If published data are corrected accordingly to achieve statistical commonality of outcome (i.e., one child in singleton versus two children in twins), twin pregnancies no longer demonstrate a significantly increased risk profile and/or cost for mothers or individual offspring.', 'title : To provide protection against sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, condoms must be used consistently and correctly. However, a significant proportion of couples in the United States fail to do so. Our objective was to determine the demographic and behavioral correlates of inconsistent and incorrect condom use among sexually active, condom-using women. : Analysis of baseline data from a prospective cohort of sexually active, condom-using women in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project (n = 2087) using self-reported demographic and behavioral characteristics. Poisson regression was used to determine the relative risk of inconsistent and incorrect condom use after adjusting for variables significant in the univariate analysis. : Inconsistent and incorrect condom use was reported by 41% (n = 847) and 36% (n = 757) of women, respectively. A greater number of unprotected acts was most strongly associated with reporting 10 or more sex acts in the past 30 days, younger age at first intercourse, less perceived partner willingness to use condoms, and lower condom use self-efficacy.

Controlled, prospective clinical study. The Assisted Reproduction Unit of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Modena. Forty-nine infertile women consecutively admitted to standard superovulation treatment. Mean age was 33.9 years, duration of infertility was 6.3 years. Reasons for assisted reproduction were mechanical factor in 22 cases, sperm problem in 9 cases, and endocrine disorder in 6 cases. In 12 cases, infertility was unexplained. More than 55% already had an IVF-ET attempt. The day of oocyte pick-up, subjects were submitted to Stroop Color and Word test, a task measuring the ability to cope with a cognitive stressor, involving attentional and sympathoadrenal systems. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, as well as heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline, during the test, and 10 minutes after the end of testing. The evidence of a biochemical pregnancy (beta-hCG value 12 days after ET) define the success and failure groups. Sixteen women (33%) had a biochemical pregnancy, 12 also had ultrasound evidence. Eight gave birth to healthy infants. Age, education, causes, and duration of infertility were similar in the success and failure groups. The latter were more involved in a job outside home than the former. Moreover, they had a lower number of both fertilized oocytes and transferred embryos.

Male scarcity in a population is associated with a cluster of characteristics related to higher mating effort and lower paternal investment. We predicted that modern populations with male scarcity would have shorter gestational times and lower birth weights on average. We compared US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention county-aggregated year 2000 birth records with US Decennial Census data. We combined these data in a path model with the degree of male scarcity and known socio-economic predictors of birth outcomes as exogenous predictors of prematurity and low birth weight, with single mother households as a proportion of families with children as a mediator (N = 450). Male scarcity was directly associated with higher rates of low birth weight. Male scarcity made significant indirect predictions of rates of prematurity and low birth weight, as mediated by the proportion of families headed by single mothers. Aggregate socio-economic status also indirectly predicted birth outcomes, as mediated by the proportion of families headed by single mothers, whereas the proportion African American retained both direct and indirect predictions of adverse birth outcomes.', 'title To identify reasons for inconsistent contraceptive use that antedate conception and continue to predispose participants in adolescent-oriented maternity programs to unsafe sexual practices after delivery. We hypothesized that teens who attributed their failure to use contraceptives before their first conception exclusively to concerns about their side effects and/or their own lack of motivation to prevent conception would report less consistent contraceptive use and more repeat conceptions than would teens who attributed their previous failure to use contraceptives to their lack of capacity to do so. We conducted a 2-year, prospective, longitudinal study of contraceptive use and repeat conceptions in a racially/ethnically diverse population of poor 13- to 18-year-olds. The 198 study participants were enrolled consecutively during their first pregnancies from an adolescent-oriented maternity program. The majority (84%) of the teens attributed their failure to use contraceptives before their first pregnancy partially to a lack of capacity to do so. As hypothesized, these teen mothers were significantly more likely to use hormonal contraceptives (85% vs 62%), (particularly Norplant, 47% vs 19%) and less likely to conceive again (13% vs 41%). Most teens attributed their inconsistent contraceptive use during the postpartum study period to three factors: side effects, plans to abstain from sexual intercourse, and their lack of motivation to postpone additional childbearing.', \"title The field of infertility medicine has witnessed a surge of scientific developments in recent years, but research on public attitudes towards infertility treatments has remained minimal.

This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2011 to April 2011 by means of an online survey administered to a sample of 287 women. Women with a longer length of awareness of ART had significantly greater attitudinal favorability towards ART. Political affiliation was also significantly related to general attitudes, as well as several specific aspects of ART issues.\", 'title In order to formulate cost-effective health interventions aimed at preventing infertility it is necessary to identify modifiable risk factors for infertility in sub-Saharan Africa. This case-control study examined potential predictors and their population attributable fraction (PAF%) for various infertility types including lifestyle factors, sexual behaviour and reproductive tract infections (RTIs). Sexually active women aged 21-45 year presenting with infertility problems at the infertility clinic of the Kigali University Teaching Hospital (n = 312), and fertile controls who recently delivered (n = 283) were surveyed together with their male partners. Participants were interviewed about socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviours and lifestyle factors, and were tested for HIV and RTIs. Variables significantly associated with tubal infertility were history of sexual violence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.41; 95% CI 1.36-4.25]; positive HIV (AOR 2.41; 95% CI 1.36-4.25), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2; AOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.03-2.71) and Chlamydia trachomatis serology (AOR 1.78; 95% CI 0.99-3.21), and current bacterial vaginosis by Amsel criteria (AOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.12-3.47).

We sought to compare these strategies to understand longitudinal differences in interstage ventricular dysfunction and their subsequent impact on transplant-free survival and atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) as well as the relationship between adverse events and ventricular function. Serial echocardiographic reports and clinical data were reviewed for 138 children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent stage I surgical palliation (Sano: 11; Norwood: 73; Hybrid: 54) between 2004 and 2011. Stage II palliation was achieved in 92 (67%) patients (Sano: 7; Norwood: 51; Hybrid: 34). Interstage transplant-free survival, ventricular dysfunction, and AVVR were equivalent among palliation strategies. Patients with preserved ventricular function had a higher rate of transplant-free survival and freedom from AVVR, regardless of palliation strategy. Patients who had cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (adverse events) experienced more transient and persistent ventricular dysfunction compared to those without adverse events. Surgical palliation strategies were not identified as risk factors for ventricular dysfunction or AVVR.', \"title Outcomes after surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with congenital cardiac disease are limited by long-term valve deterioration, which may be hastened by turbulent flow. The use of the\\xa0Trifecta valve (St. Jude Medical, Little Canada, MN) at our institution (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) appears to result in low postimplantation transvalvular gradients. This study was performed to compare the early transvalvular gradient associated with the Trifecta valve with that associated with two other valves commonly used for PVR. We performed a single institution review of patients undergoing PVR with the Perimount valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA), the Biocor valve (St. Jude Medical), or the Trifecta valve between November 1993 and January 2014. Multivariable linear regression modeling was used to determine the adjusted association between valve type and transvalvular gradient as determined by early postoperative echocardiography. A total of 186 patients met study criteria; 54\\xa0(29%) received a Biocor valve, 87 (47%) received a Perimount valve, and 45 (24%) received a Trifecta valve. There were no baseline differences among the groups, but the peak transvalvular gradient was significantly decreased among patients with the Trifecta valve. After adjustment for age, valve size, patients' weight, and time to the assessment, as compared with the Trifecta valve, the Biocor valve was associated with a 57% higher peak valve gradient (p < 0.01), whereas the Perimount valve was associated with a 26% higher peak valve gradient (p\\xa0= 0.04).\", 'title Previous studies have shown that prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) results in higher early and late mortality after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Careful selection of stented bioprostheses was recommended to avoid inadequate effective orifice area. We studied the incidence of PPM and its potential effects on clinical outcome in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement using the Carpentier-Edwards Perimount bioprosthesis. Independent predictors of early and late mortality and hospital readmission for cardiac reasons were defined in 506 patients (mean age, 73 years; range, 57 to 87 years) by multivariate analysis. Mean follow-up was 6.1 +/- 4.8 years; maximum follow-up was 18.6 years. The incidence of severe PPM (effective orifice area index < 0.65 cm2/m2) was 0.2% and of moderate PPM (effective orifice area index > 0.65 and < 0.85) was 20%. Multivariate analysis revealed that moderate PPM was not an independent predictor of early mortality, late mortality, or hospital readmission for cardiac reasons. Reduction of septal hypertrophy was similar in patients with and without moderate PPM.', 'title It can be difficult to predict which patients will survive and recover cardiac function after valve replacement surgery. We hypothesized that the expression levels of ventricular myosin light chain (MLCv) might reflect the severity of disease or the extent of irreversible myocardial damage and might be useful for predicting the postoperative course. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between MLCv expression in specimens obtained during valve replacement surgery and the postoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. The levels of expression of the regulatory MLCv (MLC-2v) and MLC-1v in papillary muscle specimens from 80 patients who underwent valve replacement surgery for rheumatic valvular disease were evaluated by Western blot analysis. The patients were similar with regard to the intraoperative expression of MLC-1v, regardless of postoperative NYHA class. The preoperative NYHA class, the end-systolic left ventricular internal dimension, and the intraoperative expression of MLC-2v emerged as independent risks factors for a NYHA class status of III/IV at 6 months after surgery, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.862.', \"title Arterial pulse pressure hypertension is associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery patients. However, its association with perioperative mortality in other high-risk surgical populations has not been determined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increased preoperative arterial pulse pressure is associated with 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality after lower extremity arterial bypass surgery. A retrospective review of patients who had infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery at a single center over a 6-year period (January 2002 to January 2008) was performed (n = 556). Mean, systolic, and diastolic arterial blood pressure were determined from a single noninvasive oscillometric blood pressure cuff reading in the operating room before the administration of anesthetic drugs. Pulse pressure was calculated from this measurement in a retrospective manner by subtracting diastolic pressure from systolic pressure. Mortality for all subjects was determined using the social security death index. Comorbid conditions, preoperative medications, and anesthetic techniques were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between arterial pulse pressure and the primary outcome variables, and all-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality. Of the 556 patients, a large percentage had elevated pulse pressure (44.9% had pulse pressure ≥80). Thirty-day mortality was 5.1% and 1-year mortality was 17.8%. There was no apparent association between preoperative pulse pressure and 30-day (P = 0.35) or 1-year (P = 0.14) all-cause mortality. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were age ≥80 years (P = 0.02), ASA physical status ≥IV (P = 0.04), baseline creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (P < 0.0001), and emergency surgery (P = 0.009).

The effects of tricuspid valve repair on quantitative measures of right ventricle and tricuspid valve remodeling have not been well documented. We reviewed retrospectively the 2-dimensional echocardiograms of 17 tricuspid valve repairs (male, n = 12; female, n = 5; median age, 30 months; age range, 1.5-53 months) performed 1 month before and after tricuspid valve repair between 2005 and 2011. From the apical 4-chamber view, we measured right ventricle end-diastolic area, right ventricle fractional area change, and tricuspid valve leaflet coaptation length. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation was graded qualitatively. A 2-sided paired t test was used to compare changes in tricuspid valve and right ventricle outcomes, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare changes in tricuspid regurgitation grades. Right ventricle end-diastolic area decreased significantly after tricuspid valve repair from 14.1 ± 5.2 to 11.8 ± 3.9 cm(2) (P = .001), whereas right ventricle fractional area change declined from 44.4% ± 6.4% to 39.7% ± 8.5% (P = .016). The coaptation length of the lateral and septal leaflet improved significantly after tricuspid valve repair (0.4 ± 2.4 mm vs 3.1 ± 2.7 mm, P = .002; 2.0 ± 2.7 vs 3.4 ± 2.0 mm, P = .036; respectively). Furthermore, the tricuspid regurgitation grade improved after tricuspid valve repair (3.1 ± 0.6 to 1.7 ± 0.9, P < .001).', 'title Several risk factors have been shown to increase mortality in cardiac surgery. However, the importance of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as an independent risk factor before cardiac surgery is unclear. Method. This observational study investigated 3024 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgical procedures at the Montreal Heart Institute from 1996 to 2000. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality with 99 deaths (3.3%) among these patients. Of the 35 variables subjected to univariate analysis, 23 demonstrated a significant association with mortality. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression identified LVEDP as an independent predictor of mortality after cardiac surgery. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model predicting mortality was 0.85.', 'title It is still not clear whether the presence of a moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch after isolated aortic valve replacement can increase 30-day mortality. The aim of this study was to determine whether a moderate mismatch is an independent predictor of early global or cardiac mortality after aortic valve replacement. The study involved 272 adult patients (median age, 72 years; interquartile range, 66-76 years) undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. Moderate mismatch was considered to be present if the projected indexed effective orifice area was < or =0.85 and >0.65 cm2/m2. Severe mismatch was present if the projected indexed effective orifice area was < or =0.65 cm2/m2. Follow-up to assess survival at 30 days was carried out in 100% of patients. Moderate mismatch was observed in 37.9% of patients. None had a severe mismatch. Multivariate analysis identified the following independent predictors of global mortality at 30 days: left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (P=.03) and age (P=.01). The same variables were identified as predictors of 30-day cardiac survival, but at a higher level of statistical significance: left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (P=.006) and age (P=.008). The analysis did not identify moderate mismatch as a predictor of global or cardiac 30-day mortality in our study population.', 'title Previous analyses have suggested an association between centre volume and in-hospital mortality, post-operative complications, and mortality in those patients who suffer from a complication. We sought to determine the nature of this association using a multicentre cohort. All the patients, aged 18 years or younger, undergoing heart surgery at centres participating in the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Database (2003-2013) were included. Programmes were grouped as follows: small 350. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the differences between groups with the adjusted in-hospital mortality, onset of any and/or major complication, and in-hospital mortality in those patients with any and/or major complication. The outcomes were adjusted for patient specific risk factors and surgical risk factors. The data set consisted of 119,345 procedures performed in 99 centres. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 4.63%; complications occurred in 23.4% of the patients. In-hospital mortality in patients with complications was 13.82%. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the risk of in-hospital death was higher in low- and medium-volume centres (p<0.001). The rate of the occurrence of any post-operative complication in small, medium, and large programmes was lower compared with very large centres (p<0.001). Low- and medium-volume centres were associated with significantly higher mortality in patients with any complication (p<0.001).', 'title The presence of multimorbidity is known to be related to adverse clinical outcomes. However, its association with mortality in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement is not known. Multimorbidity (as a continuous variable) was characterized in adults receiving cardiac valve replacement surgery between 2008 and 2012 within Kaiser Permanente Northern California based on information from health plan electronic health records. Our primary outcome was 3-year all-cause mortality after surgery. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the independent association of each additional comorbidity with mortality. Among 3686 eligible patients, mean age was 67.9±13.5years and median comorbidity burden was 3 (IQR: 2). The presence of most individual comorbidities except hypertension and hyperlipidemia did not occur in isolation. The unadjusted annual incidence (per 100 person-years) of death increased with higher comorbidity burden: ≤1: 4.61 (95% CI: 3.29-6.45), 2-3: 13.7 (95% CI: 11.9-15.8), 4-5: 23.6 (95% CI: 20.6-26.9), and ≥6: 43.4(95% CI: 34.6-54.4). Advancing age, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, heart failure, lung disease, urgent status and use of aldosterone-receptor antagonists were independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. In multivariable analyses, each additional comorbidity was significantly associated with an increased risk of long-term (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.30, 95% CI: 1.22-1.39) but not short-term mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.80-1.07).']"

Recent work has shown that the IkappaB kinase (IKK)gamma scaffolding protein is the final common adapter protein required by RIG-I.MAVS to activate divergent rate-limiting kinases downstream controlling the NF-kappaB and IRF3 pathways. Previously we discovered a ubiquitous IKKgamma splice-variant, IKKgammaDelta, that exhibits distinct signaling properties. We examined the regulation and function of IKKgamma splice forms in response to ssRNA virus infection, a condition that preferentially induces full length IKKgamma-WT mRNA expression. In IKKgammaDelta-expressing cells, we found increased viral translation and cytopathic effect compared to those expressing full length IKKgamma-WT. IKKgammaDelta fails to support viral-induced IRF3 activation in response to ssRNA infections; consequently type I IFN production and the induction of anti-viral interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) are significantly attenuated. By contrast, ectopic RIG-I.MAVS or TNFalpha-induced canonical NF-kappaB activation is preserved in IKKgammaDelta expressing cells. Increasing relative levels of IKKgamma-WT to IKKgammaDelta (while keeping total IKKgamma constant) results in increased type I IFN expression. Conversely, overexpressing IKKgammaDelta (in a background of constant IKKgamma-WT expression) shows IKKgammaDelta functions as a dominant-negative IRF3 signaling inhibitor. IKKgammaDelta binds both IKK-alpha and beta, but not TANK and IKKepsilon, indicating that exon 5 encodes an essential TANK binding domain. Finally, IKKgammaDelta displaces IKKgammaWT from MAVS explaining its domainant negative effect.', 'title Host innate antiviral immunity is the first line of defense against viral infection, and is precisely regulated by thousands of genes at various stages, including microRNAs. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) was found to be up-regualted during viral infection, and influence the host immune response. Besides, the expression of miR-155, or its functional orthologs, may also contribute to viral oncogenesis. HBV is known to cause hepatocellular carcinoma, and there is evidence that attenuated intracellular immune response is the main reason for HBV latency. Thus, we assume miR-155 may affect the immune response during HBV infection in human hepatoma cells. We found that ectopic expression of miR-155 upregulated the expression of several IFN-inducible antiviral genes in human hepatoma cells. And over-expression of miR-155 suppressed suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) expression and subsequently enhanced signal transducers and activators of transcription1 (STAT1) and signal transducers and activators of transcription3 (STAT3) phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that ectopic expression of miR-155 inhibits HBV X gene expression to some extent in vitro.', 'title Viruses of the Bunyaviridae have segmented negative-stranded RNA genomes and several of them cause significant disease.

Transcription produces capped and polyadenylated mRNAs whereas genome replication involves the synthesis of an alternative plus-sense transcript (cRNA) with unmodified termini that is copied back to vRNA. Viral mRNA transcription predominates at early stages of viral infection, while later, negative sense genome replication is favoured. However, the \"switch\" that regulates the transition from transcription to replication is poorly understood. We show that temperature strongly affects the balance between plus and minus-sense RNA synthesis with high temperature causing a large decrease in vRNA accumulation, a moderate decrease in cRNA levels but (depending on genome segment) either increased or unchanged levels of mRNA. We found no evidence implicating cellular heat shock protein activity in this effect despite the known association of hsp70 and hsp90 with viral polymerase components. Temperature-shift experiments indicated that polymerase synthesised at 41 degrees C maintained transcriptional activity even though genome replication failed. Reduced polymerase association with viral RNA was seen in vivo and in confirmation of this, in vitro binding assays showed that temperature increased the rate of dissociation of polymerase from both positive and negative sense promoters. However, the interaction of polymerase with the cRNA promoter was particularly heat labile, showing rapid dissociation even at 37 degrees C. This suggested that vRNA synthesis fails at elevated temperatures because the polymerase does not bind the promoter. In support of this hypothesis, a mutant cRNA promoter with vRNA-like sequence elements supported vRNA synthesis at higher temperatures than the wild-type promoter.', 'title To investigate the antiviral effects of vectors expressing specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in vitro and in vivo. Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 μg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 μg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 μg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys.', 'title It remains unclear whether retroviruses can encode and express an intragenomic microRNA (miRNA). Some have suggested that processing by the Drosha and Dicer enzymes might preclude the viability of a replicating retroviral RNA genome that contains a cis-embedded miRNA. To date, while many studies have shown that lentiviral vectors containing miRNAs can transduce mammalian cells and express the inserted miRNA efficiently, no study has examined the impact on the replication of a lentivirus such as HIV-1 after the deliberate intragenomic insertion of a bona fide miRNA. We have constructed several HIV-1 molecular clones, each containing a discrete cellular miRNA positioned in Nef. These retroviral genomes express the inserted miRNA and are generally replication competent in T-cells. The inserted intragenomic miRNA was observed to elicit two different consequences for HIV-1 replication. First, the expression of miRNAs with predicted target sequences in the HIV-1 genome was found to reduce viral replication. Second, in one case, where an inserted miRNA was unusually well-processed by Drosha, this processing event inhibited viral replication.', 'title Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) infection has high mortality and morbidity, and biomarkers for disease severity and prognosis are required. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, and EBV encodes multiple miRNAs. Because plasma contains sufficiently stable miRNAs, circulating EBV-associated miRNA profiles were investigated as novel biomarkers in CAEBV infection. Plasma miRNA expression was assessed for 12 miRNAs encoded within 2 EBV open reading frames (BART and BHRF). Expression levels were investigated in 19 patients with CAEBV infection, 14 patients with infectious mononucleosis, and 11 healthy controls. Relative expression levels of plasma miRNAs were determined by TaqMan probe-based quantitative assay.

Apple trees show a high degree of resistance and tolerance to viral infections. We analysed two sRNA deep sequencing datasets, prepared from different RNA size fractions, to identify sRNAs involved in Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV) infection. sRNA analysis revealed virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) originating from two ASGV genetic variants. A vsiRNA profile for one of the ASGV variants was also generated showing an increase in siRNA production towards the 3' end of the virus genome. Virus-derived sRNAs longer than those previously analysed were also observed in the sequencing data. Additionally, tRNA-derived sRNAs were identified and characterised. These sRNAs covered a broad size-range and originated from both ends of the mature tRNAs as well as from their central regions. Several tRNA-derived sRNAs showed differential regulation due to ASGV infection. No changes in microRNA, natural-antisense transcript siRNA, phased-siRNA and repeat-associated siRNA levels were observed.\", \"title Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) can persistently infect and cause limited damage to mosquito vectors. RNA interference (RNAi) is a mosquito antiviral response important in restricting RNA virus replication and has been shown to be active against some arboviruses. The goal of this study was to use a recombinant Sindbis virus (SINV; family Togaviridae; genus Alphavirus) that expresses B2 protein of Flock House virus (FHV; family Nodaviridae; genus Alphanodavirus), a protein that inhibits RNAi, to determine the effects of linking arbovirus infection with RNAi inhibition. B2 protein expression from SINV (TE/3'2J) inhibited the accumulation of non-specific small RNAs in Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture and virus-specific small RNAs both in infected cell culture and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. More viral genomic and subgenomic RNA accumulated in cells and mosquitoes infected with TE/3'2J virus expressing B2 (TE/3'2J/B2) compared to TE/3'2J and TE/3'2J virus expressing GFP. TE/3'2J/B2 exhibited increased infection rates, dissemination rates, and infectious virus titers in mosquitoes following oral bloodmeal. Following infectious oral bloodmeal, significantly more mosquitoes died when TE/3'2J/B2 was ingested. The virus was 100% lethal following intrathoracic inoculation of multiple mosquito species and lethality was dose-dependent in Ae. aegypti.\", 'title Begomoviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that cause economically important diseases of many crops throughout the world and induce symptoms in plants, including enations, leaf curling and stunting, that resemble developmental abnormalities. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that are involved in a variety of activities, including plant development, signal transduction and protein degradation, as well as response to environmental stress, and pathogen invasion. The present study was aimed at understanding the deregulation of miRNAs upon begomovirus infection. Four distinct begomoviruses African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), Cabbage leaf curl virus (CbLCuV), Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Cotton leaf curl Multan virus/Cotton leaf curl betasatellite (CLCuV/CLCuMB), were used in this study. Ten developmental miRNA were studied. N. benthamiana plants were inoculated with begomoviruses and their miRNA profiles were analysed by northern blotting using specific miRNA probes. The levels of most developmental miRNA were increased in N. benthamiana by TYLCV, CLCuMV/CLCuMB and CbLCuV infection with a common pattern despite their diverse genomic components. However, the increased levels of individual miRNAs differed for distinct begomoviruses, reflecting differences in severity of symptom phenotypes. Some of these miRNA were also common to ACMV infection.']"

Currently, there is no large focused study comparing toluidine blue (TB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains in the evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This study evaluates whether TB and H&E are comparable in assessing the presence of tumor in frozen sections of SCC. One hundred eighty-six randomized slides representing 93 tissue pieces from 36 tumors were examined by 3 Mohs surgeons (1 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education fellow and 2 fellowship-trained surgeons) and compared using a template that documented the presence and location of tumor on the slides. The evaluation of SCC with H&E and TB stains was highly concordant, with concordant identification of SCC in 96%, 96%, and 94% of tissue layers among the 3 Mohs surgeons ARS, LHG, and AK-A, respectively.', 'title Non-invasive diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) can detect and characterize breast cancer and predict tumor responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, even in patients with radiographically dense breasts. However, the relationship between measured optical parameters and pathological biomarker information needs to be further studied to connect information from optics to traditional clinical cancer biology. Thus we investigate how optically measured physiological parameters in malignant tumors such as oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin concentration, tissue blood oxygenation, and metabolic rate of oxygen correlate with microscopic histopathological biomarkers from the same malignant tumors, e.g., Ki67 proliferation markers, CD34 stained vasculature markers and nuclear morphology. In this pilot study, we investigate correlations of macroscopic physiological parameters of malignant tumors measured by diffuse optical technologies with microscopic histopathological biomarkers of the same tumors, i.e., the Ki67 proliferation marker, the CD34 stained vascular properties marker, and nuclear morphology. The tumor-to-normal relative ratio of Ki67-positive nuclei is positively correlated with DOT-measured relative tissue blood oxygen saturation (R = 0.89, p-value: 0.001), and lower tumor-to-normal deoxy-hemoglobin concentration is associated with higher expression level of Ki67 nuclei (p-value: 0.01). In a subset of the Ki67-negative group (defined by the 15 % threshold), an inverse correlation between Ki67 expression level and mammary metabolic rate of oxygen was observed (R = -0.95, p-value: 0.014). Further, CD34 stained mean-vessel-area in tumor is positively correlated with tumor-to-normal total-hemoglobin and oxy-hemoglobin concentration. Finally, we find that cell nuclei tend to have more elongated shapes in less oxygenated DOT-measured environments.', 'title To compare pretreatment and midtreatment tumor intensity as measured by T2 fat-saturation (T2-FS) MRI and its association with treatment response in cervical cancer patients. Weekly MRI scans were performed for brachytherapy planning on 23 consecutive patients with clinical Stage IB1 to IIIB cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. These scans were performed on a 1.5-T clinical scanner using a specialized pelvic coil. Mean signal intensity from T2-FS imaging was calculated for each tumor voxel. Average tumor intensity and tumor volume were recorded pre- and midtreatment (at Weeks 0 and 4). All patients subsequently underwent routine follow-up, including periodic clinical examinations and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging. Mean follow-up for surviving patients was 14.5 months. Mean tumor volume at presentation was 49.6 cc, and mean midtreatment tumor volume was 16.0 cc. There was no correlation between initial tumor volume and pretreatment signal intensity (r=0.44), nor was there a correlation between pre- or midtreatment tumor volume with disease-free survival (p=0.18, p=0.08 respectively.) However, having at least a 30% drop in signal intensity from pretreatment to midtreatment was correlated with having disease resolution on posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging (p=0.05) and with disease-free survival (p=0.03.) Estimated disease-free survival at 22 months was 100% for patients with at least a 30% drop in tumor signal intensity compared with 33% for patients above this selected threshold (p=0.004).', 'title Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and tissue microarray (TMA) technologies were jointly utilized to search for molecular features associated with clinicopathological parameters in oesophageal cancer. Two TMAs from formalin-fixed tissue samples, including 300 adenocarcinomas and 177 squamous cell carcinomas with clinical follow-up data, were analysed. MALDI-MSI analysis revealed 72 distinct mass per charge (m/z) signals associated with tumour cells, 48 of which were found in squamous cell carcinomas only, and 12 of which were specific for adenocarcinomas. In adenocarcinomas, six signals were linked to early-stage (pT1-T2) tumours (two signals) and the presence (one signal) or absence (three signals) of lymph node metastasis. In squamous cell carcinomas, 24 signals were strongly linked to different phenotypic features, including tumour stage (four signals), histological grade (four signals), and lymph node metastasis (three signals).', 'title This study investigated whether texture-based imaging parameters could identify invasive components of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We enrolled 65 biopsy-confirmed DCIS patients (62 unilateral, 3 bilateral) who underwent (18)\\u2009F-FDG PET, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), or breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI). We measured SUV max and intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity by the area under the curve (AUC) of cumulative SUV histograms (CSH) on PET, tumour-to-normal ratio (TNR) and coefficient of variation (COV) as an index of heterogeneity on BSGI, minimum ADC (ADC min ) and ADC difference (ADC diff ) as an index of heterogeneity on DWI. After surgery, final pathology was categorized as pure-DCIS (DCIS-P), DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-MI), or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Clinicopathologic features of DCIS were correlated with final classification. Final pathology confirmed 44 DCIS-P, 14 DCIS-MI, and 10 IDC. The invasive component of DCIS was significantly correlated with higher SUV max (p\\u2009=\\u20090.017) and lower AUC-CSH (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) on PET, higher TNR (p\\u2009=\\u20090.008) and COV (p\\u2009=\\u20090.035) on BSGI, lower ADC min (p\\u2009=\\u20090.016) and higher ADC diff (p\\u2009=\\u20090.009) on DWI, and larger pathologic size (p\\u2009=\\u20090.018).

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique known as sweep imaging with Fourier transform (SWIFT) to visualize the structural changes of intramandibular anatomy during invasion. Descriptive case study. Tertiary academic institution. Patients with oral carcinoma who underwent segmental mandibulectomy. Two specimens from each patient were imaged using a 9.4-T Varian MRI system. The SWIFT images were correlated with histologic sections. The SWIFT technique with in vitro specimens produced images with sufficient resolution (156-273 μm) and contrast to allow accurate depiction of tumor invasion of cortical and medullary bone. Both specimens had histopathologic evidence of mandibular invasion with tumor. A high degree of correlation was found between magnetic resonance images and histopathologic findings.', \"title Raw data from emission scanners contained in ECT sinograms can provide an abundance of information about the position of an object in the camera's field-of-view. Since some cancers can be detected by PET and SPECT which are not seen clearly on mammograms, CT or other scans, sinogram data could potentially be used to guide tumor biopsy. For example, positron-emitting (18F-labeled Fluoro-deoxyglucose) and single-photon emitting (99mTc-labeled-sestamibi) radiopharmaceuticals have been used successfully to detect many types of breast cancer. By utilizing some relatively simple geometric relationships, a sinogram-based method for biopsy of radiopharmaceutical-avid breast masses guided by data from PET and SPECT scanners has been developed and validated in phantom studies. A pair of projection views from a series of sinograms is used to calculate the position of photon-emitting objects. Calculated positions of spheres ranging in size from 1.6 to 3.4 cm diameters containing 18F and 99mTc were compared with measured positions. By adding a single radioactive fiducial marker, emission-guided biopsy of simulated breast lesions was performed with a specially designed phantom containing photon-emitting spheres 12.7 mm in diameter. Correlation between calculated and measured object coordinates were excellent (R = 1.0, R = 1.0 and R = 0.998; x, y and z coordinates, respectively). The maximum error in localization was +/- 3 mm. One hundred percent (10 of 10) of the attempted biopsies of simulated tumors were successful.\", 'title To study the feasibility of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for assessment of tumour microvasculature in endometrial carcinoma patients, and to explore correlations with histological subtype, clinical course and microstructural characteristics based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and three-dimensional DCE-MRI (1.5 T) with high temporal resolution (2.49 s) were acquired preoperatively in 55 patients. Quantitative modelling allowed the calculation of four independent parameters describing microvasculature: blood flow (Fb), extraction fraction (E), capillary transit time (Tc) and transfer constant from the extravascular extracellular space [EES] to blood (Kep); and four derived parameters: blood volume (Vb), volume of EES (Ve), capillary permeability surface area product (PS) and transfer from blood to EES (Ktrans). Endometrial carcinoma tissue exhibited reduced Fb, E, Vb, Ve, PS and Ktrans compared with normal myometrium. Non-endometrioid carcinomas (n\\u2009=\\u200912) had lower Fb, and E than endometrioid carcinomas (n\\u2009=\\u200943; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Tumour Ve positively correlated with tumour ADC value (r\\u2009=\\u20090.29, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03).

Subsequent histologic undergrading may delay adjuvant treatments. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) leads to accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in malignant glioma tissue, and is currently used for resection of malignant gliomas. The aim of this study was to clarify whether 5-ALA might serve as marker for visualization of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement for precise intraoperative tissue sampling. 5-ALA was administered in 17 patients with diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement. During glioma resection, positive fluorescence was noted by a modified neurosurgical microscope. Intraoperative topographic correlation of focal 5-ALA fluorescence with maximum (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography uptake (PET(max)) was performed. Multiple tissue samples were taken from areas of positive and/or negative 5-ALA fluorescence. Histopathological diagnosis was established according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2007 criteria. Cell proliferation was assessed for multiregional samples by MIB-1 labeling index (LI). Focal 5-ALA fluorescence was observed in 8 of 9 patients with WHO grade III diffusely infiltrating gliomas. All 8 of 8 WHO grade II diffusely infiltrating gliomas were 5-ALA negative. Focal 5-ALA fluorescence correlated topographically with PET(max) in all patients. MIB-1 LI was significantly higher in 5-ALA-positive than in nonfluorescent areas within a given tumor.', 'title To integrate MRI into CT-based 3D-brachytherapy treatment planning using a software system for image registration and fusion. Sixteen patients with recurrent head-and-neck cancer, vulvar cancer, liposarcoma, and cervical cancer were treated with interstitial (n=12) and endocavitary (n=4) brachytherapy. CT and MRI scans were performed after implantation and prior to treatment planning. Image registration to integrate the CT and MR information into a single geometric framework was performed using a software algorithm based on mutual information. Conventional 3D-brachytherapy planning based on CT-information alone was compared to brachytherapy planning based on fused CT and MRI data. The accuracy of the image fusion was measured using predefined corresponding landmarks in the CT and MRI data. The presented automated algorithm proved to be robust and reliable (mean registration error 1.8 mm, range 0.8-4.1 mm, SD 0.9 mm). Tumor visualization was difficult using CT alone in all cases. Brachytherapy treatment planning based on fused CT and MRI data enabled better definition of target volume and risk structures as compared to treatment planning based on CT alone.']"

We analyzed the impact of this mutation on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the effect of pravastatin in both carriers and noncarriers. All patients were enrolled in the quantitative coronary angiographic clinical trial REGRESS, which studied the impact of pravastatin therapy on coronary atherosclerosis.

Moreover, the adjusted relative risk for a clinical event for carriers was calculated at 2.16 (95% CI, 1.09 to 4.29; P = .027).

The study cohort included 839 young adults (aged 24 to 43 years, 70% white, 42% men) enrolled in Bogalusa Heart Study, who in 2001-2002 attended baseline examination with measurements of CV risk factors. Progression of carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) was assessed during a mean follow-up of 2.4 years.

Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a subclinical marker of atherosclerosis associated with stroke. We investigated association of reported CAD risk variants with CIMT, and with other intermediate phenotypes that may implicate causative pathways.

AIM, DESIGN AND METHODS: The objective of this study was to investigate this relationship and evaluate the ability of HbA1c levels to predict carotid atherosclerosis in a Chinese population. This was a cross-sectional study, which included 541 subjects without known diabetes (Taiwan Lifestyle Study). About 67 (9·2%) subjects were newly diagnosed with diabetes during the study. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and the presence of carotid plaques were determined using ultrasonography. The HbA1c level in all subjects was positively correlated with carotid IMT (β = 0·018, P = 0·03) after being adjusted for age, gender, smoking, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, hypertension and body mass index.

There was a positive and linear relationship between HbA1c levels and the probability of having plaques, thickened carotid IMT or both (P for all comparisons, <0·05). The ability of HbA1c levels to predict thickened carotid IMT or the presence of plaques was only modest {the optimal cutoff of HbA1c level [5·7%] was determined from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (sensitivity = 67%, specificity = 61%) and the area under the ROC curve [0·666]}.', 'title The lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Stroke, in particular, ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerotic disease, shares common mechanisms with myocardial infarction. We investigated whether the 9p21 region contributes to ischemic stroke risk. In an initial screen, 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the critical genetic interval on 9p21 were genotyped in samples from Southern Germany (1,090 cases, 1,244 control subjects) and the United Kingdom (758 cases, 872 control subjects, 3 SNPs). SNPs significantly associated with ischemic stroke or individual stroke subtypes in either of the screening samples were subsequently genotyped in 2,528 additional cases and 2,189 additional control subjects from Europe and North America. Genotyping of the screening samples demonstrated associations between seven SNPs and atherosclerotic stroke (all p < 0.05). Analysis of the full sample confirmed associations between six SNPs and atherosclerotic stroke in multivariate analyses controlling for demographic variables, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and vascular risk factors (all p < 0.05). The odds ratios for the lead SNP (rs1537378-C) were similar in the various subsamples with a pooled odds ratio of 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.37) under both fixed- and random-effects models (p = 0.002). The point estimate for the population attributable risk is 20.1% for atherosclerotic stroke.']"

We detected BRAF D594G in 7 patients and BRAF V600E in 45 patients. The clinicopathological features of cancers with BRAF D594G mutation were similar to those with BRAF wild-type, but differed from those with BRAF V600E mutations. Regarding microsatellite instability status, 44.4% of cases with BRAF V600E mutations exhibited high microsatellite instability, compared to 14.3% of those with BRAF D594G mutations and 4.4% of those with BRAF wild-type. There were no CIMP-positive tumors in cancers with BRAF D594G mutations, whereas 67.8% of tumors with BRAF V600E mutations were CIMP-positive.

A clinic-based colorectal frozen tumor bank at a single institution was queried for colon and rectal adenocarcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and analyzed for microsatellite instability, methylation, and mutations in the oncogenes KRAS and BRAF. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and clinical outcomes were compared. The 268 patients with colon cancer and 89 with rectal cancer were similar in gender, tumor size, stage, and differentiation. Colon cancers had a higher incidence of microsatellite instability (27 percent) and methylator phenotype (28 percent) compared with rectal cancers (7 percent, 3 percent, respectively; P < 0.001).

MMR-deficient cancers show frequent losses of Cdx2, a homeodomain transcription factor. Here, we determine the predictive value of Cdx2 expression for MMR-deficiency and investigate changes in expression between primary cancers and matched lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemistry for Cdx2, Mlh1, Msh2, Msh6, and Pms2 was performed on whole tissue sections from 201 patients with primary colorectal cancer and 59 cases of matched lymph node metastases.

In the present study, conducted in a Korean population, we used the TaqMan assay to investigate whether the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism was associated with colorectal cancer in 439 colorectal cancer patients and 676 healthy normal controls. We also examined whether the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism is associated with tumor location, microsatellite instability (MSI) status and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage in colorectal cancer. We found no significant difference between the cancer and control populations in terms of genotype distribution (CC, CG and GG).

We suppose that L-arginine may inhibit the process of carcinogenesis from colorectal adenoma to adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of L-arginine on the formation and development of colorectal tumors. We selected 60 patients with colorectal cancer and 60 patients with colorectal adenoma (CRA) and divided them into four groups of 30 patients each. We gave 30 g (120 mL) of L-arginine everyday for 3 days to the test groups, whereas L-arginine was substituted by 5% glucose in the control groups. The expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, survivin, and nitric oxide synthase was examined immunohistochemically, and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was examined spectrophotometrically. Serum nitric oxide (NO) was detected by the Griess assay. In patients with CRA, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and survivin labeling indexes and ODC activity of the tumor and paratumor mucosa in the L-arginine-treated group after L-arginine treatment were significantly lower as compared with the corresponding pretreatment values (P < 0.01). Moreover, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the tumor markedly increased after L-arginine treatment (P < 0.05). Serum NO levels in the patients with colorectal cancer were markedly higher than those in the patients with CRA, and L-arginine treatment was responsible for this increase (P < 0.05).', 'title Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying genetic mutations causing different clinical phenotypes. Mutation in the BRAF oncogene is a key step in malignant transformation within the methylator pathway to colorectal cancer. However, there is a paucity of information about BRAF mutant colorectal tumors. This study defines the clinical characteristics and oncologic outcome associated with colorectal cancer BRAF mutations. Colorectal adenocarcinomas from a single-institution frozen-tumor biobank were studied. Genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed for mutations in the BRAF oncogene by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by direct sequencing. A sample was classified as mutant if any of the tested loci were mutated. Patient and tumor characteristics were recorded including patient age, sex, tumor location, tumor differentiation, and microsatellite instability. Statistical associations with BRAF mutant tumors were determined by the Fisher exact probability test, χ test, or Wilcoxon analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed for overall survival. Four hundred seventy-five colorectal adenocarcinomas were included in the study population; 56 samples harbored a BRAF mutation (12%). There were significant differences between BRAF wild-type and mutant tumors in age (66 vs 75 years, p = 0.004), female sex (44% vs 71%, p < 0.001), proximal tumor location (44% vs 95%, p < 0.001), and frequency of microsatellite instability (16% vs 76%, p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer stage between BRAF mutant and wild-type populations. Survival data were analyzed for 322 patients with stage I to III disease, and patients with a BRAF mutation had decreased overall survival than those without a mutation (p = 0.018). With the use of Cox regression analysis, BRAF mutation conferred a worse overall survival (HR 1.79, CI 1.05-3.05, p = 0.03) independent of microsatellite instability status.', 'title BRAF mutant colorectal cancer carries a poor prognosis which is thought to be related to poor response to conventional chemotherapy. BRAF mutation is associated with the serrated tumour phenotype. We hypothesised that one of the mechanisms by which BRAF mutant colorectal cancer demonstrate poor outcomes with chemotherapy is abnormal gene methylation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) methylation data was analysed using a linear regression model with BRAF mutation as an independent variable. Expression datasets were also obtained to correlate functional changes. Top differentially methylated probes were taken forward for validation by methylation pyrosequencing. These probes were analysed on a cohort of patients enriched for BRAF mutations taken from the VICTOR and QUASAR2 studies. In an analysis of 91 tumours (9 BRAF mutant, 82 wild type), the Illumina probe cg11835197 was the probe identified as top differentially methylated (p = 2.56×10-7, Bayes Factor (BF) =6.54). This probe covered a region -413bp from the promoter region of TFAP2E. We found a complex pattern of CpG specific methylation of this region which was associated with both overall (p=0.044) and disease free (p=0.046) survival.', 'title Currently, first-line chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer is not tailored on predictive biomarkers.

As indicated by time-course experiments based on clonogenic assays, a 6 h pre-incubation with BBI before irradiation of HSF with a single dose of 6 Gy resulted in maximum radioprotection. In non-irradiated cells, pre-incubation with BBI resulted in an increased level of p53 protein. Concomitantly, enhanced mRNA levels of the ERCC3 and the Gadd45 genes were observed. As a consequence, BBI-treated cells showed accelerated DNA repair compared with untreated cells when irradiated.', 'title We previously screened natural compounds and found that coniferyl aldehyde (CA) was identified as an inducer of HSF1. In this study, we further examined the protective effects of CA against ionizing radiation (IR) in normal cell system. Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests were performed to evaluate expression of HSF1, HSP27, and HSP70 in response to CA. Cell death and cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 were analyzed to determine the protective effects of CA in the presence of IR or taxol. The protective effects of CA were also evaluated using animal models. CA increased stability of the HSF1 protein by phosphorylation at Ser326, which was accompanied by increased expression of HSP27 and HSP70. HSF1 phosphorylation at Ser326 by CA was mediated by EKR1/2 activation. Cotreatment of CA with IR or taxol in normal cells induced protective effects with phosphorylation- dependent patterns at Ser326 of HSF1.

In addition, the transfer of BCH from liposomes to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles was determined through gradient ultracentrifugation. BCH uptake by these glioma cells was significantly inhibited by the monoclonal antibody. The uptake by both cell lines was reversely correlated with the amount of LPDS. The presence of calcium ion promoted the BCH uptake, whereas the low temperature decreased the BCH uptake. After 16 h incubation, about 46% of BCH was transferred from liposomes to LDL particles.', 'title To study the effects of suberoyl bis-hydroxamic acid (SBHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, on the apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Apoptosis in MCF-7 cells induced by SBHA was demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis, morphological observation, and DNA ladder. Mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was measured using the fluorescent probe JC-1. The expressions of p53, p21, Bax, and PUMA were determined using RT-PCR or Western blotting analysis after the MCF-7 cells were treated with SBHA or p53 siRNA. SBHA induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. The expressions of p53, p21, Bax, and PUMA were induced, and DeltaPsim collapsed after treatment with SBHA. p53 siRNA abrogated the SBHA-induced apoptosis and the expressions of p53, p21, Bax, and PUMA.', 'title To investigate the molecular signaling mechanism by which the plant-derived, pentacyclic triterpene maslinic acid (MA) exerts anti-diabetic effects. HepG2 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of MA. The effects of MA on glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa) activity and the cellular glycogen content were measured. Western blot analyses were performed with anti-insulin receptor β (IRβ), protein kinase B (also known as Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) antibodies. Activation status of the insulin pathway was investigated using phospho-IRβ, as well as phospho-Akt, and phospho-GSK3β antibodies. The specific PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin was added to the cells to analyze the Akt expression. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the effect of MA on IRβ auto-phosphorylation. Furthermore, the effect of MA on glycogen metabolism was investigated in C57BL/6J mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). The results showed that MA exerts anti-diabetic effects by increasing glycogen content and inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase activity in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, MA was shown to induce the phosphorylation level of IRβ-subunit, Akt, and GSK3β. The MA-induced activation of Akt appeared to be specific, since it could be blocked by wortmannin. Finally, MA treatment of mice fed with a high-fat diet reduced the model-associated adiposity and insulin resistance, and increased the accumulated hepatic glycogen content.', 'title To investigate whether the apoptotic activities of 8-bromo-7-methoxychrysin (BrMC) involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC). HepG2, Bel-7402 and L-02 cell lines were cultured in vitro and the apoptotic effects of BrMC were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM) after propidium iodide (PI) staining, caspase-3 activity using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. ROS production was evaluated by FCM after dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) probe labeling. The phosphorylation level of JNK and c-Jun protein was analyzed by Western blotting. FCM after PI staining showed a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of the sub-G1 cell population (P < 0.05), reaching 39.0% +/- 2.8% of HepG2 cells after 48 h of treatment with BrMC at 10 micromol/L. The potency of BrMC to HepG2 and Bel-7402 (32.1% +/- 2.6%) cells was found to be more effective than the lead compound, chrysin (16.2% +/- 1.6% for HepG2 cells and 11.0% +/- 1.3% for Bel-7402 cell) at 40 micromol/L and similar to 5-fluorouracil (33.0% +/- 2.1% for HepG2 cells and 29.3% +/- 2.3% for Bel-7402 cells) at 10 micromol/L. BrMC had little effect on human embryo liver L-02 cells, with the percentage of sub-G1 cell population 5.4% +/- 1.8%. Treatment of HepG2 cells with BrMC for 48 h also increased the levels of active caspase-3, in a concentration-dependent manner. z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, prevented the activation of caspase-3. Treatment with BrMC at 10 micromol/L for 48 h resulted in the formation of a DNA ladder. Treatment of cells with BrMC (10 micromol/L) increased mean fluorescence intensity of DCHF-DA in HepG2 cells from 7.2 +/- 1.12 at 0 h to 79.8 +/- 3.9 at 3 h and 89.7 +/- 4.7 at 6 h. BrMC did not affect ROS generation in L-02 cells. BrMC treatment failed to induce cell death and caspase-3 activation in HepG2 cells pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (10 mmol/L). In addition, in HepG2 cells treated with BrMC (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 micromol/L) for 12 h, JNK activation was observed. Peak JNK activation occurred at 12 h post-treatment and this activation persisted for up to 24 h. The expression of phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun protein after 12 h with BrMC-treated cells was inhibited by N-acetylcysteine and SP600125 pre-treatment, but GW9662 had no effect. SP600125 substantially reduced BrMC-induced cell death and caspase-3 activation of HepG2 cells. N-acetylcysteine and GW9662 also attenuated induction of cell death and caspase-3 activation in HepG2 cells treated with BrMC.', 'title To investigate H2O2-induced promotion proliferation and malignant transformation in WB-F344 cells and anti-tumor effects of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA). WB-F344 cells were continuously exposed to 7 x 10(-7) mol/L H2O2 for 21 d. Observations of cell morphology, colony formation rates, flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle changes and aneuploidy formation indicated that H2O2 was able to induce malignant transformation of WB-F344 cells. We treated malignantly transformed WB-F344 cells with 4 μmol/L OA or 8 μmol/L UA for 72 h and analyzed the cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. MTT assay showed that 7 x 10(-7) mol/L H2O2 decreased G1 phase subpopulation from 73.8% to 49.6% compared with the control group, and increased S phase subpopulation from 14.5% to 31.8% (P < 0.05 vs control group). Cell morphology showed that nucleus to cytoplasm ratio increased, many mitotic cells, prokaryotes and even tumor giant cells were shown in H2O2-induced WB-F344 cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis showed that WB-F344 cell aneuploidy increased to 12% following H2O2 treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of the transformed WB-F344 cells following treatment with OA (4 μmol/L) and UA (8 μmol/L) showed that OA increased G1 subpopulation to 68.6%, compared to 49.7% in unexposed cells. UA increased G1 subpopulation to 67.4% compared to 49.7% in unexposed cells (P < 0.05 vs H2O2 model group).']"

It codes for a disintegrin and metalloproteinase that triggers intra- and extracellular signalling by protein shedding. We examined whether polymorphisms in ADAM33 are associated with asthma and related traits in two German populations. We genotyped 15 intragenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of allele-specific primer extension products. The transmission disequilibrium test was used for association analysis in the German asthma family study. Additionally, we tested for association of these SNPs in a case-control sample from the European Community Respiratory Health Study using Armitage's trend test. In both studies, we found SNPs that were significantly associated with asthma and related traits. In the family study, significant associations were observed for the SNPs F+1, ST+4 and ST+5 (with the lowest P-value for F+1, P=0.005). Remarkably, this association is seen even in the absence of linkage with two microsatellite markers from a previous genome scan either 3.1 million bases (Mb) up- or 5.6 Mb downstream. In the case-control study, SNP ST+7 (P=0.008) was significantly associated with asthma. Some of these SNPs overlapped with those found to be associated with elevated total IgE levels and bronchial hyper-responsiveness.\", 'title The specific genetic contributions to childhood asthma have been difficult to elucidate. A recent whole-genome association study suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms at loci controlling the expression of the ORMDL3 gene and others in the neighborhood of the NRG1 and ERO1LB genes might be important. We sought to replicate the associations of these genetic markers with asthma in a large population of asthmatic patients from Scotland and to assess the effect of these variants on asthma outcomes. Using mouthwash-derived DNA and clinical interviews and measurements, we investigated the association of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the candidate genes with susceptibility to asthma in a case-control study and also exacerbations in a group of 1054 patients aged 3 to 22 years. A common C/T polymorphism at a locus controlling ORMDL3 gene expression (rs7216389) was significantly associated with the risk of childhood asthma (P = 1.73 x 10(-12)), with a single copy of the T allele conferring an odds ratio of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.24-1.81) and 2 copies of the T allele conferring an odds ratio of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.71-2.61), respectively. In asthmatic patients the T allele was associated with exacerbations of the condition (P = .008). Polymorphisms at the loci of nearby genes for NRG1 (rs4512342) and ERO1LB (rs10924993) were associated with neither the occurrence of nor exacerbations of asthma.', 'title A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 33 (ADAM33) gene has been considered as an asthma susceptibility gene due to its possible role in airway remodeling, abnormal cell proliferation, and differentiation. Association of this gene with asthma has been reported in several genetic studies on various populations.

The basic allelic and genotypic model was analyzed for association of the SNPs with asthma using SHEsis software. Haploview software was used to calculate pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) among six of the genotyped SNPs. Of the 8 SNPs genotyped, only S2[rs528557] showed significant association with asthma (Allele p\\u2009=\\u20090.0189, Genotype p\\u2009=\\u20090.021).

We therefore evaluated the integrin-beta3 gene (ITGB3), an integrin gene within an asthma linkage peak on chromosome 17, as a candidate for susceptibility to asthma- and atopy-related phenotypes. We genotyped and performed association tests on 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms in ITGB3 in the Hutterites, a founder population, and in three outbred replication populations. Variation in ITGB3 was strongly associated with susceptibility to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and protection from allergic sensitization to mold allergens in this population. Three independent case-control populations representing Caucasians and African Americans were used to replicate this finding, also revealing ITGB3 alleles that are associated with asthma susceptibility and protection from mold allergen sensitization.', 'title Multiple genetic and environmental factors impact the pathogenesis of asthma. ADAM33 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 33) represents a novel susceptibility gene for asthma in several diverse populations. The aim of this study was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADAM33 gene associate with asthma susceptibility and severity in the Chinese Han population. A total of 224 subjects were enrolled, including 74 normal controls and 150 asthmatic patients. The asthmatic enrollees were further categorized into high- or low-severity groups according to the percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 second of predicted value, symptoms, nighttime awakening, requirement for short-acting β2-agonist, and interference with normal activities. Six SNPs (F + 1, ST + 4, S1, S2, T1, and T2) in ADAM33 were genotyped using the polymerase chain restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Three SNPs (F + 1, T1, and T2) of ADAM33 were found to have significant associations with asthma in the study population (p = .0058-.0067). The allele frequencies of two SNPs (F + 1, T1) in both the low- and high-severity groups were significantly different from the allele frequency in the control group. The allelic frequency of the T2 SNP was significantly different from that of the control group only in the high-severity group (p = .0081). Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the frequency of 7575G, 12433T, and 12462C (GTC haplotype) is higher in healthy controls than amongst asthma patients (78.4% vs. 61.8%, p = .0004).', 'title ADAM33 has been described to be the first positional cloned asthma gene.

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was employed to study the genotypic distribution of F+1, T1, and S2 in ADAM33 in a cohort of 120 pediatric asthma patients and 105 healthy controls. The serum levels of secreted ADAM33 protein were measured in all the study subjects using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This case-control study showed that the distribution of F+1 and T1 genotypes of ADAM33 was not significantly different between pediatric asthma patients and healthy controls (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05); however, the genotype and allele frequencies of the S2 polymorphism were significantly different between asthmatic patients and healthy controls (both p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, the frequency of CGC and CGG haplotypes exhibited statistically significant differences, with lower CGC and higher CGG frequencies found in the case group compared to the control group. Finally, in comparison to healthy controls, the serum levels of ADAM33 protein were significantly lower in patients carrying the S2 polymorphism.', 'title A recent report provided evidence that a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 33 (ADAM33), a member of the ADAM family, is a novel susceptibility gene in asthma linked to bronchial hyper-responsiveness. However, there has been no investigation of the genetic role of ADAM33 variants in nasal allergy. The purpose of this study was to test the association between ADAM33 polymorphisms and Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCPsis), a most common seasonal allergic rhinitis in Japan. We conducted a case-control association study among a Japanese population, involving 95 adult individuals with JCPsis and 95 normal healthy controls. A total of 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAM33 were genotyped using PCR-based molecular methods. Six SNPs of ADAM33 gene, three in introns (7575G/A, 9073G/A and 12540C/T) and three in the coding region (10918G/C, 12433T/C and 12462C/T), were strongly associated with JCPsis (P = 0.0002-0.022 for absolute allele frequencies) and most of the SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. A higher frequency of the common alleles of these SNPs was noted for the subjects with JCPsis in comparison with healthy controls. We also identified a haplotype associated with the disease susceptibility. In addition, associations were found between ADAM33 polymorphisms and various cedar pollinosis phenotypes including clinical severity, eosinophil counts in nasal secretion and allergen-specific IgE levels in sera, but not total serum IgE levels.', 'title ADAM33 is the first identified asthma gene by positional cloning, especially asthma combined with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Moreover, ADAM33 is associated with early-life lung function and decline of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) in the general population. In utero and postnatal cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) are associated with reduced lung function, and development of BHR and asthma. We hypothesized that this may occur via interaction with ADAM33.

The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of rosuvastatin users identified a sub-genome-wide association of rs6924995, a single-nucleotide polymorphism ≈10 kb downstream of myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP, aka IDOL and inducible degrader of low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR]), with LDL cholesterol statin response. Interestingly, although this signal was initially attributed to MYLIP, rs6924995 lies within RP1-13D10.2, an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA. Using simvastatin and sham incubated lymphoblastoid cell lines from participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) simvastatin clinical trial, we found that statin-induced change in RP1-13D10.2 levels differed between cell lines from the tails of the white and black low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response distributions, whereas no difference in MYLIP was observed. RP1-13D10.2 overexpression in Huh7 and HepG2 increased LDLR transcript levels, increased LDL uptake, and decreased media levels of apolipoprotein B. In addition, we found a trend of slight differences in the effects of RP1-13D10.2 overexpression on LDLR transcript levels between hepatoma cells transfected with the rs6924995 A versus G allele and a suggestion of an association between rs6924995 and RP1-10D13.2 expression levels in the CAP lymphoblastoid cell lines.

It is unclear whether the location of spasm is related to outcome. This study compared the clinical features and prognosis of patients with coronary spasm at the site of significant atherosclerotic stenosis with patients with spasm at sites without stenosis or nonsignificant stenosis. This was a retrospective, observational study of 1,877 consecutive patients with typical or atypical angina-like chest pain undergoing acetylcholine (ACh)-provocation testing. A total of 1,760 patients were eligible for analysis. ACh-provoked coronary spasm and significant organic stenosis were observed in 873 and 358 patients, respectively. In patients with significant atherosclerotic stenosis, ACh-positive patients (n = 233) were younger and without diabetes mellitus compared with nonspasm patients (n = 125). In patients without organic stenosis, ACh-positive patients (n = 640) were older, had dyslipidemia, and were more likely to have a family history of ischemic heart disease than nonspasm patients (n = 762). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified ST-segment elevation during anginal attacks, organic stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, and multivessel spasm as correlates of spasm at sites of significant organic stenosis (n = 192).

Atherosclerosis also performs an important role in the progression of AS, because of the similarities of pathological mechanisms in both conditions. The electrocardiogram (EKG) strain pattern is associated with structural myocardial change and subendocardial ischemia and has been worldwide used as a marker of AS severity. We hypothesized that EKG strain pattern would be a marker of atherosclerosis as well in AS patients. The aim of this study was to associate the presence of EKG strain pattern in AS patients with the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). Fifty-two consecutive patients referred from the cardiology clinic with moderate or severe AS were included in the study and underwent clinical evaluation, EKG, transthoracic echocardiography, and carotid ultrasonography, following statistical analysis of the results.

At follow-up (mean 47 months, range 1-118 months), 55 MACEs occurred (14 nonfatal MI, 14 nonfatal strokes, 17 peripheral artery procedures and 10 cardiovascular deaths) (incidence = 7.8% person-years). An increased risk for incident events was observed among the high ADAM17 score individuals both in univariable (HR 19.20, 95% CI 15.82-63.36, p < 0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR 3.42, 95% CI 1.55-7.54, p < 0.001). Finally we found that ADAM17 score significantly increases the prediction accuracy of the Framingham Recurring-Coronary-Heart-Disease-Score, with a significant improvement in discrimination (integrated discrimination improvement = 9%, p = 0.012) and correctly reclassifying 10% of events and 41% of non-events resulting in a cNRI = 0.51 (p = 0.005).', 'title Genetic variation at the chromosome 9p21 cardiovascular risk locus has been associated with peripheral artery disease, but its mechanism remains unknown. To determine whether this association is secondary to an increase in atherosclerosis, or it is the result of a separate angiogenesis-related mechanism. Quantitative evaluation of human vascular samples revealed that carriers of the 9p21 risk allele possess a significantly higher burden of immature intraplaque microvessels than carriers of the ancestral allele, irrespective of lesion size or patient comorbidity. To determine whether aberrant angiogenesis also occurs under nonatherosclerotic conditions, we performed femoral artery ligation surgery in mice lacking the 9p21 candidate gene, Cdkn2b. These animals developed advanced hindlimb ischemia and digital autoamputation, secondary to a defect in the capacity of the Cdkn2b-deficient smooth muscle cell to support the developing neovessel. Microarray studies identified impaired transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling in cultured cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B)-deficient cells, as well as TGFβ1 upregulation in the vasculature of 9p21 risk allele carriers. Molecular signaling studies indicated that loss of CDKN2B impairs the expression of the inhibitory factor, SMAD-7, which promotes downstream TGFβ activation. Ultimately, this manifests in the upregulation of a poorly studied effector molecule, TGFβ1-induced-1, which is a TGFβ-rheostat known to have antagonistic effects on the endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell. Dual knockdown studies confirmed the reversibility of the proposed mechanism, in vitro.', 'title Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory condition and increased blood levels of inflammatory biomarkers have been observed in acute coronary syndromes. In addition, high expression of inflammatory markers is associated with worse prognosis of coronary artery disease. The presence and extent of inducible ischemia in patients with stable angina has previously been shown to have strong prognostic value. We hypothesized that evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia by local lesions, as measured by fractional flow reserve (FFR), is associated with increased levels of blood based inflammatory biomarkers. Whole blood samples of 89 patients with stable angina pectoris and 16 healthy controls were analyzed. The patients with stable angina pectoris underwent coronary angiography and FFR of all coronary lesions. We analyzed plasma levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α and membrane expression of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4, CD11b, CD62L and CD14 on monocytes and granulocytes as markers of inflammation. Furthermore, we quantified the severity of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease by calculating Functional Syntax Score (FSS), an extension of the Syntax Score. For the majority of biomarkers, we observed lower levels in the healthy control group compared with patients with stable angina who underwent coronary catheterization. We found no difference for any of the selected biomarkers between patients with a positive FFR (≤ 0.75) and negative FFR (>0.80). We observed no relationship between the investigated biomarkers and FSS.', 'title Atherosclerosis is influenced by the interaction of environmental and genetic susceptibility risk factors. We used global microarray expression profiling to investigate differentially regulated genes in aorta during development of atherosclerosis in a susceptible genetically modified mouse model in response to the interaction between risk factors including hyperlipidemic genotype, shear stress, diet, and age. In this study we investigated transcriptional changes in lesion-prone and lesion-resistant regions of aortas in genetically modified mice lacking both genes of the LDL receptor and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme (LDb; Ldlr(-/-)Apobec1(-/-)). Risk factors including hyperlipidemic genotype (LDb vs. C57BL/6 wildtype), shear stress (lesion-prone vs. lesion resistant aortic regions), diet (chow vs. Western high-fat), and age (2- vs. 8-months) were studied. We hybridized aortic RNA samples with microarray chips containing probes for 45,000 mouse genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Overall, the differentially expressed genes were components of 20 metabolic and physiological pathways. Notably, calcium signaling is the major pathway identified with differential regulation of 30 genes within this pathway. We also found differential expression of calcium-signaling genes in cultured primary endothelial cells from lesion-prone and lesion-resistant arterial regions (LDb mice vs. C57BL/6 controls), providing further support for involvement of calcium signaling in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover, we demonstrated protein expression of genes in the calcium-signaling pathway using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence.', 'title Previously, we scanned all 23,000 human genes for differential expression between normal and atherosclerotic tissues and found the involvement of ADAM8. We investigated the expression of ADAM8 mRNA and protein level in human atherosclerotic tissues and non-atherosclerotic internal thoracic arteries as well as the association of ADAM8 2662 T/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and with the risk of fatal myocardial infarction. ADAM8 mRNA was up-regulated in carotid, aortic, and femoral atherosclerotic plaques (n=24) when compared with non-atherosclerotic arteries. ADAM8 protein expression was increased in advanced atherosclerotic plaques as compared to control vessels wherein it was localized to macrophages and smooth muscle cells The G allele carriers of the ADAM8 2662 T/G SNP had significantly larger areas of fibrotic, calcified, and complicated plaques in coronary arteries (P=0.027, P=0.011, and P=0.011, respectively) and significantly higher occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) (P=0.004) and fatal pre-hospital MI (P=0.003) than did the TT homozygotes.', 'title Estrogen receptor α (ERα) has been shown to protect against atherosclerosis. Methylation of the ERα gene can reduce ERα expression leading to a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Recently, microRNAs have been found to regulate DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and thus control methylation status in several genes. We first searched for microRNAs involved in DNMT-associated DNA methylation in the ERα gene. We also tested whether statin and a traditional Chinese medicine (San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang, SHXXT) could exert a therapeutic effect on microRNA, DNMT and ERα methylation. The ERα expression was decreased and ERα methylation was increased in LPS-treated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and the aorta from rats under a high-fat diet. MicroRNA-152 was found to be down regulated in the LPS-treated HASMCs. We validated that microRNA-152 can knock down DNMT1 in HASMCs leading to hypermethylation of the ERα gene. Statin had no effect on microRNA-152, DNMT1 or ERα expression. On the contrary, SHXXT could restore microRNA-152, decrease DNMT1 and increase ERα expression in both cellular and animal studies.', 'title Polymorphisms found in genes encoding adhesion molecules have been reported to be associated with atherosclerosis. We investigated the Ser128Arg polymorphism in the E-selectin gene in Japanese patients with myocardial infarction and its functional significance. Results from 135 patients with myocardial infarction and 327 control subjects revealed that the frequency of Arg128-positive was significantly higher in the patients than in controls (12.6% versus 6.7%; odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.85), indicating that the Ser128Arg polymorphism was associated with myocardial infarction. We then generated a recombinant E-selectin adenovirus carrying a mutation (AdS128R-E) and compared it with its wild-type counterpart by evaluating the adhesion characteristics of transduced human umbilical vein endothelial cells under flow. AdS128R-E-transduced human umbilical vein endothelial cells supported significantly more rolling and adhesion of neutrophils and mononuclear cells compared with human umbilical vein endothelial cells transduced with AdWT-E (P<0.001) and also exhibited significantly greater levels of phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, suggesting that an altered endothelial signaling pathway is associated with this polymorphism.']"

Crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, has been demonstrated to provide dramatic clinical benefits in ALK-positive advanced-stage NSCLC. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has been established in clinical trials as the standard procedure method for detecting ALK rearrangements. Although the detection of ALK by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been proposed for the screening of patients, large-scale studies are warranted to validate such a hierarchical approach. In this article, we report the largest series thus far of parallel FISH and IHC ALK testing in 3244 consecutive NSCLC cases analyzed at two independent French centers. FISH-positive and/or IHC-positive results were demonstrated in 150 of 3244 cases (4.6%). An imbalanced sex ratio was detected, with women exhibiting a 2.2-fold relative risk for an alteration. Strikingly, only 80 of 150 specimens were classified as ALK positive by both techniques. The specimens with discordant FISH/IHC analyses were FISH-positive/IHC-negative (36), FISH-negative/IHC-positive (19), or FISH-noncontributive/IHC-positive (15). Thus, a single FISH or IHC analysis performed alone would have failed to detect approximately one-fourth of the ALK-positive cases with similar findings in our two centers.', 'title The anaplastic large cell kinase gene (ALK) is rearranged in approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population. We evaluated the incidence and the characteristics of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas within the western population and the optimal diagnostic modality to detect ALK rearrangements in routine clinical practice. We tested 358 lung adenocarcinomas from three institutions for ALK rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry with and without tyramide amplification. The clinicopathologic characteristics of tumors with and without ALK rearrangements were compared. We identified 20 (5.6%) lung adenocarcinomas with ALK rearrangements within our cohort of western patients. ALK rearrangement was associated with younger age (P = 0.0002), never smoking (P < 0.0001), advanced clinical stage (P = 0.0001), and a solid histology with signet-ring cells (P < 0.0001). ALK rearrangement was identified by FISH in 95% of cases and immunohistochemistry with and without tyramide amplification in 80% and 40% of cases, respectively, but neither FISH nor immunohistochemistry alone detected all cases with ALK rearrangement on initial screening.

Emerging clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with RET-rearranged NSCLC may also benefit from existing RET TKIs, including cabozantinib and vandetanib. However, the reported cases of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) harboring gene rearrangements have been detected via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) from materials such as biopsy or resection. Fusion events identified in lung SCC raise the question of whether this histologic subtype should also be evaluated for merit molecular testing. This work was undertaken to study the prevalence of lung SCC harboring ALK, ROS1, and RET translocations. Squamous cell carcinomas were confirmed using both histological examination by pathologists and immunohistochemistry analysis with positive staining of P63 and CK5/6 combined with negative CK7 and TTF-1 staining. 214 samples from surgically resected patient tissues were used to search for ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements by a NanoString analysis method.

ALK copy number changes and amplification, which plays an oncogenic role in tumors such as neuroblastoma, are poorly characterized in NSCLC. We aimed to study the prevalence of ALK copy number changes and their correlation to ALK protein expression, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status, and clinicopathological data in patients with NSCLC. ALK status was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Specimens with ALK translocation were studied for echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), KIF5B, and TFG status. ALK expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. EGFR gene and protein status were evaluated in adenocarcinomas. Survival analysis was performed. One hundred seven NSCLC cases were evaluated. There were two cases of EML4-ALK translocation and one with an atypical translocation of ALK. Both cases of EML4-ALK translocation had ALK protein expression, whereas in the rest, ALK was undetected. Eleven cases (10%) exhibited ALK amplification and 68 (63%) copy number gains. There was an association between ALK amplification and EGFR FISH positivity (p < 0.0001) but not with prognosis. In conclusion, EML4-ALK translocation is a rare event in NSCLC.', \"title Oncogenic fusion of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 protein or other partner genes occurs in 3% to 6% of lung adenocarcinomas.

We report here an ALK FISH-positive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) that was nonresponsive to crizotinib therapy. The PDX patient human lung cancer (PHLC402) was established in NOD/SCID mice from a patient with resected pT4N1M0 lung adenocarcinoma. ALK gene status was investigated using the standard FISH break-apart assay, reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical assay using the 5A4 antibody. PHLC402 was treated with crizotinib (50 mg/kg) by daily oral gavage. ALK FISH assay was positive in both the primary patient tumor and PDX, which were negative for ALK protein expression by immunohistochemical analysis. ALK fusion product was not detected by RNA sequencing and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction comparing the 5' and 3' ALK transcript levels. Crizotinib treatment of PHLC402 grown in mice resulted in no tumor response.\", 'title Activated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions are recurrent events in a small fraction of colorectal cancers (CRCs), although these events have not yet been exploited as in other malignancies. We detected ALK protein expression by immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridisation in the ALKA-372-001 phase I study of the pan-Trk, ROS1, and ALK inhibitor entrectinib. One out of 487 CRCs showed ALK positivity with a peculiar pattern that prompted further characterisation by targeted sequencing using anchored multiplex PCR. A novel ALK fusion with the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) gene (CAD-ALK fusion gene) was identified. It resulted from inversion within chromosome 2 and the fusion of exons 1-35 of CAD with exons 20-29 of ALK. After failure of previous standard therapies, treatment of this patient with the ALK inhibitor entrectinib resulted in a durable objective tumour response.', 'title Acquired resistance mutations to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors such as crizotinib and alectinib have been documented in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring ALK rearrangement (ALK+). Of note I1171T/N/S mutations in the ALK kinase domain have recently been described by several groups to confer resistance to alectinib, a second-generation ALK inhibitor. Additionally one of these reports demonstrated one ALK+ NSCLC patient harboring an I1171T acquired mutation has responded to ceritinib, another second-generation ALK inhibitor. We reported the presence of an ALK I1171N resistance mutation from comprehensive genomic profiling from a liver biopsy of a progressing metastatic lesion in an ALK+ patient on alectinib after an initial partial response. The patient then responded to ceritinib 750 mg orally once daily but required dose reduction to 600 mg once daily. She initially had grade 3 elevation of liver enzymes from crizotinib necessitating the original switch to alectinib but experienced no transaminase elevations with alectinib or ceritinib.', 'title Recently, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been found to be altered in several solid and haematological tumours. ALK gene copy number changes and mutations in colorectal cancers (CRCs) are not well characterised. We aimed to study the prevalence of ALK copy number changes, translocations, gene mutations and protein expression in 770 CRC patients, and correlate these findings with molecular and clinico-pathological data. ALK gene copy number variations and ALK expression were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Translocations of the ALK gene were not observed; 3.4% (26 out of 756) of the CRC patients tested had an increase in ALK gene copy number either amplification or gain. Interestingly, increased ALK gene copy number alteration was associated with poor prognosis (P=0.0135) and was an independent prognostic marker in multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. The study reveals a significant impact of ALK gene copy number alterations on the outcome of patients with CRC.', 'title Activating mutations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) were recently described in neuroblastoma. We carried out a meta-analysis of 709 neuroblastoma tumors to determine their frequency and mutation spectrum in relation to genomic and clinical parameters, and studied the prognostic significance of ALK copy number and expression. The frequency and type of ALK mutations, copy number gain, and expression were analyzed in a new series of 254 neuroblastoma tumors. Data from 455 published cases were used for further in-depth analysis. ALK mutations were present in 6.9% of 709 investigated tumors, and mutations were found in similar frequencies in favorable [International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) 1, 2, and 4S; 5.7%] and unfavorable (INSS 3 and 4; 7.5%) neuroblastomas (P = 0.087). Two hotspot mutations, at positions R1275 and F1174, were observed (49% and 34.7% of the mutated cases, respectively). Interestingly, the F1174 mutations occurred in a high proportion of MYCN-amplified cases (P = 0.001), and this combined occurrence was associated with a particular poor outcome, suggesting a positive cooperative effect between both aberrations. Furthermore, the F1174L mutant was characterized by a higher degree of autophosphorylation and a more potent transforming capacity as compared with the R1275Q mutant. Chromosome 2p gains, including the ALK locus (91.8%), were associated with a significantly increased ALK expression, which was also correlated with poor survival.']"

Present knowledge allows the incorporation of therapeutic genes that can modify the expression of disease predisposing genes, an effect that can last from months to years. In line with the above, we have tested if inhibiting the expression of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2) by an anti-Aldh2 antisense gene can curtail the drive of alcohol-dependent animals to consume alcohol. Wistar-derived rats bred as high alcohol drinkers (UChB; Universidad de Chile Bibulous) were rendered alcohol dependent by a 2-month period of voluntary ethanol (10%) intake, subjected to a 3-day withdrawal period and further allowed access to 10% ethanol for only 1 hour each day. This condition results in a high ethanol intake (1.2 g/kg/60 min) which is 10 times higher than that of naïve UChB rats. The single intravenous administration of an anti-Aldh2 antisense gene carried by an adenoviral vector reduced liver ALDH2 activity by 85% (p < 0.002) and inhibited voluntary ethanol intake by 50% (ANOVA p < 0.005) for 34 days.', 'title Alcohol consumption is heritable, but genetic susceptibility to drinking behavior has not been investigated widely in genome-wide association studies. We aimed to identify susceptibility loci for drinking behavior (drinkers compared with nondrinkers) in Han Chinese. We performed 2 genome-wide association studies including 1420 drinkers and 3590 nondrinkers in discovery, followed by a de novo replication analysis comprising 4896 drinkers and 13,293 nondrinkers. DNA samples of the subjects were collected for genotyping. The association results of drinking behavior (drinkers or nondrinkers) showed a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms at 12q24 in discovery (P < 5 × 10(-8)), with the strongest association for rs11066280 near C12orf51 (P-combined = 3.26 × 10(-215)). Moreover, we observed the association with drinking behavior for a functional variant in ALDH2 at 12q24 (rs671, P-discovery = 5.17 × 10(-35)). We also identified the association between rs11066280 and daily alcohol intake among drinkers (P-combined = 4.01 × 10(-21)).', 'title Two genome-wide association studies recently showed alcohol dependence to be associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs13273672) located on a gene (GATA4) that encodes a transcription factor of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). A growing body of evidence suggests that ANP might be involved in the symptomology of alcohol dependence. This study examined whether reactivity to alcohol cues in the ANP target region amygdala, a key area implicated in addictive behavior, differs depending on the GATA4 genotype of a patient. We also investigated potential associations between these differences in amygdala activation and relapse behavior. Eighty-one abstinent, alcohol-dependent patients completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging cue-reactivity task in a 3-Tesla scanner and provided blood samples for DNA extraction. The results showed significantly lower alcohol-cue-induced activations in G-allele carriers as compared with AA-homozygotes in the bilateral amygdala. A survival analysis revealed that a stronger alcohol-specific amygdala response predicted a lowered risk for relapse to heavy drinking in the AA-homozygotes, whereas this effect could not be observed in G-allele carriers.', 'title As recent conflicting reports describe a genetic association between both the C- and the T-alleles of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) C957T polymorphism (rs6277) in alcohol-dependent subjects, our aim was to examine this polymorphism and TaqIA (rs1800497) in Australian alcohol-dependent subjects. The C957T polymorphism was genotyped in 228 patients with alcohol dependence (72 females and 156 males) and 228 healthy controls. The C-allele and C/C genotype of C957T was associated with alcohol dependence, whereas the TaqIA polymorphism was not. When analysed separately for C957T, males showed an even stronger association with the C-allele and females showed no association. The C957T and TaqIA haplotyping revealed a strong association with alcohol dependence and a double-genotype analysis (combining C957T and TaqIA genotypes) revealed that the relative risk of different genotypes varied by up to 27-fold with the TT/A1A2 having an 8.5-fold lower risk of alcohol dependence than other genotypes.', 'title We previously mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ethanol preference drinking to mouse chromosome 2 (mapped with high confidence, LOD = 15.5, p = 3 x 10(-16)). The specific gene(s) in the QTL interval responsible for phenotypic variation in ethanol preference drinking has not been identified. In the current study, we investigated the association of the syntaxin binding protein 1 gene (Stxbp1) with ethanol preference drinking and other ethanol traits using a panel of B6 x D2 (BXD) recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred mouse strains. Confirmation analyses for ethanol consumption and withdrawal were performed using a large B6D2 F2 cross, short-term selected lines derived from the B6 and D2 progenitor strains, and standard inbred strains. BXD RI strain analysis detected provisional associations between Stxbp1 molecular variants and ethanol consumption, as well as severity of acute ethanol withdrawal, ethanol-conditioned taste aversion, and ethanol-induced hypothermia. Confirmation analyses using three independent genetic models supported the involvement of Stxbp1 in ethanol preference drinking but not in ethanol withdrawal.', 'title A previous genome-wide linkage study of alcohol dependence in multiplex families found a suggestive linkage result for a region on Chromosome 1 near microsatellite markers D1S196 and D1S2878. The KIAA0040 gene has been mapped to this region (1q24 - q25). A recent genome-wide association study using SAGE (the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment) and COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) found five SNPs within the KIAA0040 gene significantly associated with alcohol dependence. A meta-analysis using data from these sources also found the KIAA0040 gene significantly associated with alcohol dependence. Using family data consisting of 1000 individuals with phenotypic data (762 with both phenotype and DNA), finer mapping of a 0.3 cM region that included the KIAA0040 gene and a flanking gene was undertaken using SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.15 and pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) of r Significant FBAT p-values were observed for six SNPs, four within the KIAA0040 gene (rs2269650, rs2861158, rs1008459, rs2272785) and two adjacent to KIAA0040 (rs10912899 and rs3753555). Five haplotype blocks of varying size were identified using HAPLOVIEW. Analysis using the haplotype-based test function of FBAT revealed one two-SNP block (rs1008459-rs2272785) associated with alcohol dependence. This block showed a pattern of transmission in which one haplotype, CT, with a frequency of 0.577 was found to be over-transmitted to affected offspring (p = 0.017) while another haplotype, AG, with a frequency of 0.238 was found to be under-transmitted to affected offspring (p = 0.006). A three-SNP block (rs1008459-rs2272785-rs375355) showed an overall significant association (p = 0.011) with alcohol dependence with the haplotype ACT over-transmitted to affected offspring (p = 0.016) and the haplotype GAG under-transmitted (p = 0.002).', \"title Variation in genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits has been implicated in the risk of alcohol dependence (AD). We sought to replicate and extend previous findings of a moderating effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GABRA2 (which encodes the GABAA α-2 subunit) on the subjective effects of alcohol by examining SNPs in this and the adjacent GABRG1 gene on chromosome 4. Fifty-two European-Americans (22 males, 28 light drinkers and 24 heavy drinkers) completed 3 laboratory sessions, during which they drank low-dose, high-dose, or placebo alcohol prior to undergoing periodic assessments of stimulation, sedation and drug enjoyment. We genotyped subjects for three SNPs previously associated with AD: rs279858 in GABRA2, and rs7654165 and rs6447493 in GABRG1. Two SNPs were associated with altered stimulatory effects of alcohol as measured on the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale, (rs279858: P = 0.0046; rs6447493: P = 0.0023); both effects were in the opposite direction of previous findings. Carriers of the rs279858 C allele experienced greater stimulation from alcohol. Further inspection of the rs6447493 interaction did not support a pharmacogenetic effect. The effects of rs279858 (but not the other two SNPs) on items from a secondary outcome measure, the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ), were significant. Higher ratings by individuals with the C allele were observed on the DEQ items 'feel the alcohol effect' (P < 0.001), 'like the alcohol effect' (P < 0.001) and feel 'high' (P < 0.001).\", 'title We previously reported a risk genomic region (ie, PTP4A1-PHF3-EYS) for alcohol dependence in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We also reported a rare variant constellation across this region that was significantly associated with alcohol dependence. In the present study, we significantly increased the marker density within this region and examined the specificity of the associations of common variants for alcohol dependence. One African-American discovery sample (681 cases with alcohol dependence and 508 controls), one European-American replication sample (1,409 alcohol dependent cases and 1,518 controls), and one European-Australian replication sample (a total of 6,438 family subjects with 1,645 alcohol dependent probands) underwent association analysis. A total of 38,714 subjects from 18 other cohorts with 10 different neuropsychiatric disorders served as contrast groups. We found 289 SNPs that were nominally associated with alcohol dependence in the discovery sample (p < .05). Fifty-six associations of them were significant after correction (1.9 × 10(-6) ≤ p ≤ 1.6 × 10(-5)). No markers were significantly associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders after experiment-wide correction.', \"title Significant evidence has accumulated to suggest an association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GABRA2 gene and alcoholism. However, research has yet to show an association between these polymorphisms and the human brain's reward system function. In this study, we stratified subjects who had participated in an fMRI study of alcohol cue responses according to their genotype at a SNP in GABRA2 (rs279871) shown to be associated with alcohol dependence (Edenberg et al., 2004). Genotyping showed 13 subjects to be homozygous for the high-risk allele (AA), and 23 subjects to be heterozygous (AG). In fMRI, subjects were exposed to the aromas of their preferred alcoholic drink odors (AO), as well as to appetitive control odors (ApCO) under both alcohol intoxication and placebo control conditions. Homozygous AA subjects had a larger [AO > ApCO] response than did AG subjects in medial frontal cortical areas thought to code reward value. However, AG subjects had a larger [AO > ApCO] effect in the ventral tegmental area. Alcohol intoxication did not alter these group differences.\"]"

Patients who were aged 6 years or older (older group) were matched with patients who were aged 6 months to 3 years and were treated at the same hospital (younger groups). The total number of analyzed patients was 1498 (749 matched pairs). The proportion of complete KD in the older group was similar to that in the younger group. Recurrent cases in the older group were significantly more common than those in the younger group (9% vs 2%). The proportion of patients who were treated with intravenous gamma-globulin in the older group was significantly lower than that in the younger group (82% vs 87%). The proportion of older group patients who were treated with intravenous gamma-globulin at or after 7 days of illness was significantly higher than that in the younger group (35% vs 14%).

To study the clinical characteristics of various grades of KP. In this prospective cross-sectional study, 202 patients with vitiligo were studied between January 2011 and December 2012 for the presence of KP. Based on the new Vitiligo European Task Force guidelines, KP was classified as type 1-3 and grades Ι-IV. Disease characteristics were studied in the various groups and subgroups based on the presence of KP. Koebner phenomenon was seen in 130 of 202 patients. The mean age of patients showing KP was 23.9 ± 13.6 years, compared with 19.3 ± 12.4 years for patients not showing KP (P = 0.02). The mean body surface area involved in the KP-positive group was 4.6 ± 5.6%, vs. 1.5 ± 1.1% in the KP-negative group (P = 0.001). Fifty-five patients experiencing KP received low-dose dexamethasone oral minipulse therapy compared with nine of those who did not (P = 0.01).

Haptoglobin (Hp) is an acute-phase protein whose phenotype is known to be involved in coronary artery diseases. In this paper, we report the investigation of the association of Hp phenotype with the formation of CAA in KD. Forty-seven consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed KD were admitted. Sera were taken before therapy of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) plus aspirin, and levels of serum proteins were measured by a rate immunonephelometer. The echocardiographic criteria for coronary artery abnormality were evaluated during acute or subacute stages. Hp phenotyping was performed by Western immunoblotting. Duration of fever at diagnosis of KD was significantly different between patients with Hp 2-2 (6.4 +/- 1.2 days, n = 25) and with Hp1 allele (Hp 2-1 plus Hp 1-1; 8.8 +/- 3.5 days, n = 22). In contrast, serum levels of Hp between KD patients with Hp2-2 and with Hp1 allele (297 +/- 121 mg dL-1 vs. 330 +/- 101 mg dL-1, respectively) was not significantly different. On the other hand, no patients with Hp 2-2 (0/25) were recognized as having KD in subacute stage. However, 5 out of 20 patients with Hp 2-1 were recognized in subacute stage, and their incidence of CAA was 80.0% (4/5).', 'title Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis primarily affecting children who are <5 years old. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard therapy for KD. However, many patients with KD still show poor response to initial IVIG treatment. This study was conducted to investigate the risk factors for initial IVIG treatment failure in KD. Children who met KD diagnosis criteria and were admitted for IVIG treatment were retrospectively enrolled for analysis. Patients were divided into IVIG-responsive and IVIG-resistant groups. Initial laboratory data before IVIG treatment were collected for analysis. A total of 131 patients were enrolled during the study period. At 48 h after completion of initial IVIG treatment, 20 patients (15.3%) had an elevated body temperature. Univariate analysis showed that patients who had initial findings of high neutrophil count, abnormal liver function, low serum albumin level (≤2.9 g/dL) and pericardial effusion were at risk for IVIG treatment failure. Multivariate analysis with a logistic regression procedure showed that serum albumin level was considered the independent predicting factor of IVIG resistance in patients with KD (p = 0.006, OR = 40, 95% CI: 52.8-562). There was no significant correlation between age, gender, fever duration before IVIG treatment, haemoglobin level, total leucocyte and platelet counts, C-reactive protein level, or sterile pyuria and initial IVIG treatment failure.

From January 2001 to July 2007, 161 patients with an age younger than 1 year (younger group) and 60 patients with an age older than 5 years (older group) were diagnosed with KD at the Korea University Medical Center. Their medical records were reviewed retrospectively and the two groups were compared in terms of a number of variables commonly associated with the development of CAA, including clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. While the overall incidence of KD-associated CAA in our hospital was 6.7%, CAA developed in 20 (12.4%) of the younger group and ten (16.7%) of the older group, respectively. The CAA (+) cases of the younger group had a longer duration of total fever (9.1 +/- 3.3 vs 6.3 +/- 1.9 days, p = 0.002) and showed fewer diagnostic symptoms (3.0 +/- 1.2 vs 4.3 +/- 1.1, p < 0.001) than the CAA (-) cases. The CAA (+) cases of the older group had a longer duration of total fever (14.1 +/- 10.4 vs 6.5 +/- 1.9 days, p = 0.045), especially with respect to post-intravenous gamma globulin (IVGG) fever (7.9 +/- 9.6 vs 1.1 +/- 0.8 days, p = 0.052), and had higher total white blood cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein levels, total bilirubin levels, and Harada scores and lower serum albumin and sodium levels than the CAA (-) cases. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors that were associated significantly with the development of CAA were the number of total symptoms (OR = 0.494, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.281-0.871, p = 0.015) in the younger group and the duration of post-IVGG fever (OR = 1.958, 95% CI = 1.098-3.492, p = 0.023) and the Harada score (OR = 3.455, 95% CI = 1.012-11.796, p = 0.048) in the older group.', 'title To explore the implication of serial coronary changes on the late coronary outcomes in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) with coronary aneurysms ≧ 4 mm. We performed a retrospective review of 78 patients with KD with large coronary aneurysms (1980-2013, male: 76.9%; 792 patient-years). Progressive coronary dilatation was defined for those with progressive enlargement of coronary arteries in 3 consecutive echocardiograms. We studied 27 patients with KD with giant aneurysms (≧ 8 mm) and 51 patients with KD with medium aneurysms (4-8 mm). All the giant and 43.1% of medium aneurysms persisted during the study period. For the patients with giant aneurysms, their 10-year freedom from acute myocardial infarction/cardiovascular death and all ischemia was 66% and 52%, respectively. The median intervals for the aneurysm diameters reaching their peak were 3.3 months (giant) and 0.25 months (medium), respectively. In patients with giant aneurysms, the 10-year freedom from ischemia was much lower in those with progressive coronary dilatation (28% vs 59%, P = .021). In patients with medium aneurysms, the probability of 5-year persistence of aneurysm was much greater (67.2% vs 14.8%, P < 10(-3)) in those with progressive coronary dilatation.

We investigated whether 3 IL-10 genetic polymorphisms (-1082 A/G, -819 T/C, and -592 A/C) are associated with development of CALs in KD. The genotyping of IL-10 polymorphisms was conducted for 279 KD children (172 without and 107 with CALs in acute stage). Thirty-three patients had CALs in chronic stage and 74 only with transient CALs. The homozygous variant genotype CC of IL-10-819 and IL-10-592 was associated with 80% (P=0.006) and 79% (P=0.008) reduction in risk of CALs in acute stage, respectively. The C allele of IL-10-819 and IL-10-592 was associated with 34% (P=0.034) and 33% (P=0.044) reduction in risk of CALs in acute stage, respectively. Compared with ATA haplotype (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.63, P=0.029) or non-ACC haplotype (AOR 0.64, P=0.033), ACC haplotype was associated with a significantly reduced risk for CALs in acute stage, but not for CALs in chronic stage.

Because the principal symptoms are deeply connected with KD, it is thus important to investigate the usefulness of the principal symptoms for evaluating the disease severity of KD. Patients with definite KD or suspicion of KD were retrospectively examined. Blood test data and the incidence of patients who failed to respond to the initial i.v. immunoglobulin treatment (non-responders) were compared between patients with six principal symptoms, including fever of ≤ 4 days, before treatment of KD (six-symptom patients), and those with five or fewer symptoms (five-symptom patients). The study group of 207 patients who were treated with immunoglobulin consisted of 121 six-symptom patients and 86 five-symptom patients. The six-symptom patients were older and had higher neutrophil proportion and total bilirubin, and lower serum sodium at diagnosis than the five-symptom patients. Although the treatments did not differ between the groups, the six-symptom patients had a higher incidence of non-responders than the five-symptom patients (17% vs 5%; P= 0.008). Logistic regression analysis showed that six-symptom status was related to the risk of being a non-responder (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.6-17.4).

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that these noncoronary markers for carditis are associated with abnormalities in strain (ε) and strain rate (SR) in patients with MR or PE not appreciated by conventional echocardiography. Longitudinal and circumferential ε and SR analyses were retrospectively performed on patients with KD. Patients with and without MR or PE were compared. Strain values were also compared between patients with and without coronary artery lesions. Values for ejection fraction, shortening fraction, and clinical laboratory parameters were correlated with MR or PE. Follow-up echocardiographic outcomes were recorded at the first encounter after initial diagnosis. Follow-up ε and SR data were also obtained in the group with MR or PE and altered ventricular mechanics at diagnosis. Of the 110 patients reviewed, 92 had appropriate image quality for either longitudinal ε and SR or circumferential ε and SR analysis. Twenty-eight patients (30%) had either MR or PE.

Shortening fraction and ejection fraction were within the normal range in both groups.', 'title As Kawasaki disease (KD) shares many clinical features with other more common febrile illnesses and misdiagnosis, leading to a delay in treatment, increases the risk of coronary artery damage, a diagnostic test for KD is urgently needed. We sought to develop a panel of biomarkers that could distinguish between acute KD patients and febrile controls (FC) with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful. Plasma samples were collected from three independent cohorts of FC and acute KD patients who met the American Heart Association definition for KD and presented within the first 10 d of fever. The levels of 88 biomarkers associated with inflammation were assessed by Luminex bead technology. Unsupervised clustering followed by supervised clustering using a Random Forest model was used to find a panel of candidate biomarkers. A panel of biomarkers commonly available in the hospital laboratory (absolute neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase, concentrations of α-1-antitrypsin, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen, and platelet count) accurately diagnosed 81-96% of KD patients in a series of three independent cohorts.']"

Leukemic mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in prolymphocytic transformation must be excluded. Case archives were retrospectively reviewed for B-PLL in patients without a previous diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other B-cell neoplasm. We identified six cases of B-PLL with available cytogenetic data, five of which showed evidence of aberrations in MYC. Three cases showed additional signals for the MYC gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and two cases demonstrated t(8;14)MYC/IGH by karyotyping or FISH. High levels of MYC protein expression were detected in all cases tested with MYC aberrations.",

         "['title B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of small immature B lymphocytes which do not undergo apoptosis due to an underlying defect. One potential mechanism of defective apoptosis could be irregular oxidative stress. The goal of our investigation was to determine in vitro production of oxidative stress markers by lymphocytes of B-CLL patients. 30 untreated stage A B-CLL patients, as well as 20 stage B and C patients and 30 healthy volunteers as a control group were examined. Nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by spectrophotometry in supernatants of lymphocytes cultures of all 3 investigational groups. The method applied for detecting apoptosis was fluorescence microscopic analysis using acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double staining. In vitro lymphocyte production of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and MDA was increased in B-CLL patients, while there were no statistical significantly differences of NO production among the tested groups. Compared with the spontaneous apoptosis observed in control subjects lymphocytes, B-CLL lymphocytes showed increased percentages of apoptotic cells after incubation for 24 h. Disease progression was not followed with significant differences in spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL lymphocytes.', 'title Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) leading to expression of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. The BCR-ABL protein has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for CML pathogenesis by promoting cell apoptosis resistance; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with BCR-ABL expression and apoptosis impairment in CML leukemic cells have not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic genes in BCR-ABL(+) cells from patients in different phases of CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) according to their imatinib (IM) response by qPCR. Phosphotyrosine and c-ABL expressions in HL-60.BCR-ABL cells treated with TKI were done by Western blot. We found that dasatinib (DAS) modulated miR-let-7d, miR-let-7e, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21, miR-130a and miR-142-3p expressions while IM modulated miR-15a and miR-130a levels. miR-16, miR-130a and miR-145 expressions were modulated by nilotinib (NIL). We observed higher miR-15a, miR-130b and miR-145; and lower miR-16, miR-26a and miR-146a expressions in CML-CP in comparison with controls. CML-AP patients showed low miR-let-7d, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-29c, miR-142-3p, miR-145, and miR-146a levels in comparison with CML-CP. We noted that the miR-26a, miR-29c, miR-130b and miR-146a expressions were downregulated in IM resistant patients in comparison with IM responsive patients.', 'title Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable with standard therapy, and is characterized by excessive expansion of monoclonal abnormal mature B cells and more regulatory immune properties of T cell compartment. Thus, developing novel strategies to enhance immune function merits further investigation as a possible therapy for CLL. We generated a fusion cytokine (fusokine) arising from the combination of human GM-CSF and IL-4 (named GIFT4). Primary CLL cells were treated with GIFT4 or GM-CSG and IL-4 in vitro. GIFT4-triggered STAT5 signaling in CLL cells was examined by Western blot. The phenotype and secretome of GIFT4-treated CLL cells (GIFT4-CLL cells), and the immune stimulatory function of GIFT4-CLL cells on autologous T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and luminex assay. GIFT4-CLL up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 and adhesion molecule CD54. GIFT4-CLL cells secreted IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1 and substantial IL-2 relative to unstimulated CLL cells. GIFT4 treatment led to JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3-mediated hyper-phosphorylation of STAT5 in primary CLL cells, which is essential for GIFT4-triggered conversion of CLL cells. GIFT4-CLL cells directly propelled the expansion of autologous IFN-γ-producing CD314(+) cytotoxic T cells in vitro, and that these could lyse autologous CLL cells. Furthermore, administration of GIFT4 protein promoted the expansion of human T cells in NOD-scid IL2Rγ(null) immune deficient mice adoptively pre-transferred with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with CLL.', 'title Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by the constitutive activation of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Bcr-Abl-T315I is the predominant mutation that causes resistance to imatinib, cytotoxic drugs, and the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The emergence of imatinib resistance in patients with CML leads to searching for novel approaches to the treatment of CML. Gambogic acid, a small molecule derived from Chinese herb gamboges, has been approved for phase II clinical trial for cancer therapy by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this study, we investigated the effect of gambogic acid on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing Bcr-Abl-T315I or wild-type Bcr-Abl. CML cell lines (KBM5, KBM5-T315I, and K562), primary cells from patients with CML with clinical resistance to imatinib, and normal monocytes from healthy volunteers were treated with gambogic acid, imatinib, or their combination, followed by measuring the effects on cell growth, apoptosis, and signal pathways. The in vivo antitumor activity of gambogic acid and its combination with imatinib was also assessed with nude xenografts. Gambogic acid induced apoptosis and cell proliferation inhibition in CML cells and inhibited the growth of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I xenografts in nude mice. Our data suggest that GA-induced proteasome inhibition is required for caspase activation in both imatinib-resistant and -sensitive CML cells, and caspase activation is required for gambogic acid-induced Bcr-Abl downregulation and apoptotic cell death.', 'title Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease with a characteristic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (TK) fusion protein. Despite the clinical efficacy accomplished by TKIs therapies, disease progression may affect patient response rate to these inhibitors due to a multitude of factors that could lead to development of a mechanism known as multidrug resistance (MDR). 7-Ketocholesterol (7KC) is an oxidized cholesterol derivative that has been extensively reported to cause cell death in a variety of cancer models. In this study, we showed the in vitro efficacy of 7KC against MDR leukemia cell line, Lucena. 7KC treatment induced reduction in cell viability, together with apoptosis-mediated cell death. Moreover, downregulation of MDR protein caused intracellular drug accumulation and 7KC co-incubation with either Daunorubicin or Vincristine reduced cell viability compared to the use of each drug alone. Additionally, quantitative label-free mass spectrometry-based protein quantification showed alteration of different molecular pathways involved in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and misfolded protein response. Conclusively, this study highlights the effect of 7KC as a sensitizing agent of multidrug resistance CML and elucidates its molecular mechanisms.', 'title Chronic myelogenous leukemia is characterized by a clonal expansion of abnormal hematopoietic cells, which eventually replaces normal hematopoiesis. We wanted to test the hypothesis that the growth kinetics of CML and normal hematopoietic cells are different. We compared the growth kinetics and the phenotype of engraftment of chronic phase CML and normal human CD34(+) precursor cells in the bone marrow of immune deficient mice. High levels of engraftment of normal precursors occurred early and consisted of myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and lymphoid elements. This level and pattern of engraftment were maintained at later assessments. The level of CML cell engraftment was initially much lower, but it increased progressively at late time-points with no indication of a plateau in growth. Early engraftment of CML cells consisted almost entirely of myeloid and mast cells but soon after only mast cells were detectable. Conversely mast cells were infrequent in mice engrafted with normal progenitors.', 'title Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is driven by the fusion kinase Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate (IM), revolutionized CML therapy. Nevertheless, about 20 % of CMLs display primary or acquired TKI resistance. TKI resistance can be either caused by mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain or by aberrant signaling by its effectors, e.g. Lyn or Gab2. Bcr-Abl mutations are frequently observed in TKI resistance and can only in some cases be overcome by second line TKIs. In addition, we have previously shown that the formation of Gab2 complexes can be regulated by Bcr-Abl and that Gab2 signaling counteracts the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Therefore, TKI resistance still represents a challenge for disease management and alternative therapies are urgently needed. Using different CML cell lines and models, we identified the clinically approved TKIs sorafenib (SF) and axitinib (AX) as drugs overcoming the resistance mediated by the Bcr Abl(T315I) mutant as well as the one mediated by Gab2 and Lyn(Y508F). In addition, we demonstrated that AX mainly affects the Bcr-Abl/Grb2/Gab2 axis, whereas SF seems to act independently of the fusion kinase and most likely by blocking signaling pathways up- and downstream of Gab2.', 'title Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell disorder, but it is also associated with abnormalities in T-lymphocyte function. In this study we examine changes in T-lymphocyte CD39 and CD73 expression in patients with CLL. Blood samples were drawn from 34 patients with CLL and 31 controls. The cells were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD39, and CD73 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Overall, patients with CLL had a higher percentage of CD39(+) T lymphocytes than did controls. The percentage of cells expressing CD39 was higher in both CD4(+) cells and CD8(+) cells. Higher CD3/CD39 expression was associated with a later disease stage. No correlations between T-lymphocyte CD39 levels and CD38 or Zap-70 expression were observed. In contrast, the percentage of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes that expressed CD73 was decreased in patients with CLL. Average B-lymphocyte CD73 expression was decreased in CLL because the majority of CLL clones were CD73. However a minority of CLL clones were CD73(+), and patients with CD73(+) clones tended to have earlier stage disease.', 'title Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which leukemic cells display a reciprocal t(9:22) chromosomal translocation that results in the formation of the chimeric BCR-ABL oncoprotein, with a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Consequently, BCR-ABL causes increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and altered adhesion of leukemic blasts to the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. It has been well documented that cancer cells can generate their own signals in order to sustain their growth and survival, and recent studies have revealed the role of cancer-derived exosomes in activating signal transduction pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation. Exosomes are small vesicles of 40-100 nm in diameter that are initially formed within the endosomal compartment, and are secreted when a multivesicular body (MVB) fuses with the plasma membrane. These vesicles are released by many cell types including cancer cells, and are considered messengers in intercellular communication. We have previously shown that CML cells released exosomes able to affect the tumor microenvironment. CML cells, exposed up to one week, to exosomes showed a dose-dependent increased proliferation compared with controls. Moreover, exosome treatment promotes the formation of LAMA84 colonies in methylcellulose. In a CML xenograft model, treatment of mice with exosomes caused a greater increase in tumor size compared with controls (PBS-treated mice). Real time PCR and Western Blot analysis showed, in both in vitro and in vivo samples, an increase in mRNA and protein levels of anti-apoptotic molecules, such as BCL-w, BCL-xl, and survivin, and a reduction of the pro-apoptotic molecules BAD, BAX and PUMA. We also found that TGF- β1 was enriched in CML-exosomes. Our investigations showed that exosome-stimulated proliferation of leukemia cells, as well as the exosome-mediated activation of an anti-apoptotic phenotype, can be inhibited by blocking TGF-β1 signaling.', 'title B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by accumulation of CD5(+) B lymphocytes. Decreased VLA-4 (Cd49d/CD29) and CD11a expression and defective adhesion in B-CLL have been previously shown, although there was no substantial data about its importance in immunobiology of B-CLL. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-met, plays a role in adhesion by acting on VLA-4. c-met and VLA-4 share crucial signaling molecules in cell survival. In this study, relationship between expressions of c-met and CD49d, CD11a, and additional common signaling molecules in B-CLL was investigated. White blood cells from 24 patients with CLL were studied by flow cytometry and/or western blotting prior to and after culturing with recombinant HGF. HGF level from sera was measured with a bead-based flow cytometric assay. c-metα and c-metβ were expressed on B-CLL cells, while no expression was observed on normal donor CD19+ cells. This increase was inversely correlated with decreased expression of adhesion molecules. Serum level of HGF in B-CLL was found to be increased. In vitro experiments showed that HGF supported survival in B-CLL cells supporting the possible function of HGF/c-met pathway in B-CLL. Furthermore, expressions of critical signaling molecules shared by both VLA-4 and HGF/c-met systems including Bcl-XL, Akt, PI3K, and phospho-bad(136) following HGF stimulations of B-CLL cells have been found to be increased.']"

AAC grades (r = 0.676, p < 0.0001) and age (r = 0.518, p < 0.0001) were significantly and positively correlated with CAC score. Presence of AAC was independently associated with the presence of CAC (OR: 11.20, 95 % CI 4.25 to 29.52). An AAC grade of ≥ 2 was the strongest independent predictor of a high-risk CAC score (OR: 27.42, 95 % CI 6.09 to 123.52).

Coronary artery calcification predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality, and is\\xa0typically measured on ECG-gated 3 mm CT scans. Patients undergo standard 6 mm chest CTs for various clinical indications much more frequently, but CAC is not usually quantified. To better understand the usefulness of standard\\xa0chest CTs to quantify CAC, we conducted a case-control study among persons who had both scan types. Between 2000 and 2003, 4,544 community-living individuals self- or physician-referred for \"whole-body\" CT scans, had 3 mm ECG-gated CTs and standard 6 mm chest CTs, and were followed for mortality through 2009. In this nested case-control study, we identified 157 deaths and 494 controls frequency matched (1:3) on age and sex. The Agatston method quantified CAC on both scan types. Unconditional logistic regression determined associations with mortality, accounting for CVD risk factors. Participants were 68 ± 11 years of age and 63% male. The Spearman correlation of CAC scores between the 2\\xa0scan types was 0.93 (p\\xa0< 0.001); median CAC scores were lower on 6 mm CTs compared to 3 mm CTs (22\\xa0vs.104 Agatston units, p\\xa0< 0.001). Adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors, each standard deviation higher CAC\\xa0score on 6 mm CTs was associated with 50% higher odds of death (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.2\\xa0to 1.9), similar to 50% higher odds on the 3 mm ECG-gated CTs (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.1\\xa0to\\xa01.9).']"

To test whether subjects could learn and retain the ability to alter the relative activity of abdominal muscle groups when performing trunk curl exercises. Although trunk curl exercises are widely prescribed, a disadvantage of trunk curls is that they primarily activate rectus abdominis, while the internal and external oblique abdominis muscles are considered to be more important contributors to lumbar stability. A convenience sample of 25 subjects performed trunk curl exercises in accordance with 3 different sets of instructions: nonspecific instructions (NS), instructions intended to emphasize rectus abdominis activity (RE), and instructions intended to emphasize oblique abdominis activity (OE). Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from the upper and lower rectus and the internal and external oblique abdominis muscles while a physical target was used to insure that the trunk was raised to the same height for all conditions. Normalized root-mean-square EMG amplitude measures were used to test for instruction-dependent changes in the relative EMG activity of the rectus and oblique muscle groups. Following a single, brief, instruction session, subjects performing trunk curls had significantly greater normalized oblique:rectus EMG ratios when following OE instructions (mean [+/- SD] oblique-rectus ratio, 1.45 +/- 0.34) than when following RE (mean [+/- SD] oblique-rectus ratio, 0.76 +/- 0.24) or NS (mean [ISD] oblique-rectus ratio, 0.63 +/- 0.23) instructions. Retesting 1 week later indicated that subjects retained this skill.', 'title Athletes often employ prophylactic braces to reduce the risk of ankle injuries. Ankle braces do not significantly decrease the risk of forced inversion on a standardized one-footed jump landing. Controlled laboratory study. Fourteen healthy men with a mean age of 25.1 years were tested. Three braces, two semirigid (Aircast and Bledsoe) and one lace-up (Swede-O), were fitted to each subject. Forced dynamic ankle inversion of 24 degrees was to be resisted as the subjects landed on one foot with a force of two body weights on a stimulus presented randomly in 5 of 15 jump trial blocks onto a hard, level force plate. Subjects first completed 1 no-brace block of 5 trials to establish baseline performance, then 3 randomly ordered 15-trial blocks testing performance with each of the braces, and then finally a no-brace 5-trial block. The average no-brace success rate was 24%, which demonstrated the challenging nature of the task. All three braces increased the success rate (average, 44%); however, only the two semirigid braces proved to be significantly better than the unbraced state.', 'title Theoretical and empirical data support the notion that distal lower extremity joint dysfunction could influence the low-back injury potential of workers, but the impact of unilateral ankle immobilization on low-back loading during lifting has yet to be examined. To examine the influence of unilateral ankle immobilization on the kinematics and kinetics of lifting. With and without their right ankle immobilized, 10 men performed laboratory-simulated occupational lifting tasks. Together with force platform data, three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and lower extremities were collected, and a dynamic biomechanical model was used to calculate peak compressive and shear loads imposed on the L4/L5 intervertebral joint. In comparison to the unaffected conditions, ankle immobilization generally resulted in less knee (0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.07) and greater lumbar spine (0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.35) sagittal motion when lifting. Associated with this compensatory movement strategy were greater L4/L5 anterior/posterior reaction shear forces (0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.25). However, there were cases when individual compensatory movement strategies differed from the \"group\" response (i.e., subjects increased their sagittal knee motion on the affected side about 8% of the time); this resulted in increased peak L4/L5 joint compression forces without changing the peak L4/L5 anterior-posterior shear forces.', 'title The present study investigated associations between trunk muscle strength, jump performance, and lower limb kinematics during drop jumps on stable and unstable surfaces. Next to this behavioral approach, correlations were also computed on a neuromuscular level between trunk and leg muscle activity during the same test conditions. Twenty-nine healthy and physically active subjects (age 23 ± 3 years) were enrolled in this study. Peak isokinetic torque (PIT) of the trunk flexors and extensors was assessed separately on an isokinetic device. In addition, tests included drop jumps (DJ) on a force plate under stable and unstable (i.e., balance pad on top of the force plate) surfaces. Lower limb kinematics as well as electromyographic activity of selected trunk and leg muscles were analyzed. Significant positive but small correlations (0.50 ≤ r ≤ 0.66, p < 0.05) were detected between trunk extensor PIT and athletic performance measures (i.e., DJ height, DJ performance index), irrespective of surface condition. Further, significant negative but small correlation coefficients were examined between trunk extensor PIT and knee valgus motion under stable and unstable surface conditions (-0.48 ≤ r ≤ -0.45, p < 0.05). In addition, significant positive but small correlations (0.45 ≤ r ≤ 0.68, p < 0.05) were found between trunk and leg muscle activity, irrespective of surface condition.', 'title Eccentric exercises are increasingly being used to treat lower limb musculoskeletal conditions such as Achilles tendinopathy.

Lower limb stiffness, sagittal plane ankle kinematics, and temporal muscle activity of the agonist (soleus) and antagonist (tibialis anterior) muscles, measured during sub-maximal hopping on a custom-built sledge-jump system. Eccentric loading altered ankle kinematics during sub-maximal hopping; peak ankle angle shifted to a less dorsiflexed position by 2.9° and ankle angle pre-contact shifted by 4.4° (p<0.001). Lower limb stiffness increased from 5.9 to 6.8 Nm', 'title The aim of this study is to evaluate if the application of a moderate aerobic exercise protocol reverses the damage caused by diabetes on the mechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Forty-four rats were divided randomly into four groups as follows: Sedentary Control Group-SCG, Sedentary Diabetic Group-SDG, Trained Control Group-TCG and Trained Diabetic Group-TDG, the trained groups were submitted to a protocol of moderate physical training on a continuous treadmill. For mechanical testing the tendons were fixed in a conventional mechanical testing machine and pulled to the point of failure of the specimen, the cell load of 500N. The parameters were: Elastic Modulus (MPa), Stress Maximum Strength (MPa), Strain Specific Maximum Force (mm), Energy / Tendon Area (N.mm/mm(2)) and Cross-sectional Area (mm(2)). The evaluation of the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon of the SDG indicated that the elastic modulus (MPa) is decreased when compared to the TDG and the other groups (p<0.01). However, the specific deformation (%), the deformation at maximum force (mm), and energy / tendon area (N.mm/mm(2)) of the SDG were significantly higher than in the other groups (p<0.01).

However, it remains unclear whether males and females exhibit similar joint loading during the various athletic motions. The purpose of this study was to identify gender differences in knee biomechanics during the athletic motions. Three-dimensional knee kinematics and kinetics were investigated in 20 recreational athletes (10 males and 10 females) while jumping rope, backward running, side running, side-to-side running, side-to-forward running, inside turning, and outside turning. The strengths of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, the knee joint force, the knee joint angle, and the knee joint moment were compared between males and females using one-tailed t tests. Peak knee anterior force was greater in female recreational athletes than in their male counterparts during jumping rope, side-to-forward running, inside turning, and outside turning. Female subjects displayed greater peak knee abduction angles and greater peak knee flexion moments while jumping rope compared to their male counterparts. There were no significant differences between the sexes in knee kinematics and kinetics in the frontal and transverse planes during running and turning motions.', 'title People vary in flexibility regarding maximum joint angle, resistance to stretch and mechanical responses during stretching exercises. Body composition (BC) has been been mentioned as one of the factors for flexibility differences. The aim of this study was to determine how body composition and anthropometric measures of the lower limb is associated with passive knee extension (PKE) torque-angle (T-A) response. Twenty-five male subjects with poor flexibility performed a maximal PKE repetition (velocity of 2°/s; 90 seconds in the static phase).

To examine for changes in recruitment of the hip and back extensor muscles during low level isometric trunk rotation efforts in chronic low back pain (CLBP) subjects by comparison with matched asymptomatic control subjects. Anatomic and biomechanical models have provided evidence that muscles attaching to the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) are important for providing stabilization to the lumbopelvic region during trunk rotation. This has guided rehabilitation programs. The muscles that link diagonally to the posterior layer of the TLF have not previously been examined individually and compared during low-level trunk rotation efforts in CLBP patients and matched controls. Thirty CLBP patients and 30 matched controls were assessed using surface electromyography (EMG) as they performed low-level isometric rotation efforts while standing upright. Muscles studied included latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, upper and lower gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris. Subjects performed the rotation exertion with various levels of external trunk support, related to different functional tasks. EMG results demonstrated that subjects with CLBP had significantly higher levels of recruitment for the lower and upper gluteus maximus (P < 0.05), hamstrings (P < 0.05), and erector spinae muscles (P < 0.05) during rotation to the left compared with the control subjects.']"

Overall 30-day complication rate was 9.4%, with gastrointestinal leakage occurring in only 0.6%. A low threshold for readmission was maintained due to the short mean admission time of 1.87 days. Readmission rate was 4.8%--mainly for observation of postoperative pain--and 1.8% of our patients required reoperation within 30 days. Mortality was 0.1%.

Perioperative data also included total volume of intra-operative fluids administered, rate of administration, urine output, length of surgery, and incidence of PONV as determined by nursing or anesthesia records in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Data were analyzed by t-test. The table below depicts demographic and perioperative data, comparing patients who experienced PONV (n=125) in the PACU with those who did not (n=55). Values are mean +/- standard deviation.', 'title Bariatric surgery, including laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), achieves the greatest long-term weight loss in severe obesity. Approximately 50%-60% of severely obese patients have gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a substantial proportion is taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine-2 blocker (H2 B) at the time of LRYGB. The objective of this study was to explore the association of PPI/H2 B use before LRYGB with suboptimal percent weight loss (PWL) after LRYGB. This was a cohort study of 472 consecutive patients who underwent LRYGB at a single center from 2004-2011. Suboptimal PWL was defined as<14% at 2 months,<25% at 6 months, and<30% at 12 months. Because of effect modification by age, stratified analyses (by median age of 40 yr) were performed. All models were adjusted for appropriate covariates, including obesity-associated co-morbidities. For patients aged ≤40 years, PPI/H2 B use leading up to LRYGB was not associated with suboptimal PWL at 2 months (P = .86), 6 months (P = .47), or 12 months (P = .66). However, for patients aged>40 years, PPI/H2 B use leading up to LRYGB was associated with a nonsignificant increase in suboptimal PWL at 2 months (odds ratio [OR] 2.23; P = .08) and significant increases in suboptimal PWL at 6 months (OR 7.23; P = .002) and 12 months (OR 11.1; P = .02). Results were independent of GERD.', 'title Weight loss after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) varies. Dietary habits that exist preoperatively may continue after surgery and affect weight loss. This study investigated the hypothesis that preoperative carbohydrate addiction would predict weight loss after laparoscopic gastric bypass. 104 consecutive patients in our LRYGBP program were included in the study. A preoperative survey was used to determine level of carbohydrate craving. This survey was scored from 0 to 60. A higher score indicated a higher level of carbohydrate addiction. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was determined after at least 1 year postoperatively in all patients. Data were available in 95 (91%) of the patients. There was no correlation seen between level of carbohydrate addiction and %EWL at 1 year (r=0.02; P=NS). In addition, we looked at patients with successful weight loss (>50% %EWL; n=83) versus those patients who were considered unsuccessful (<50% EWL; n=12). There was no statistical difference in the level of preoperative carbohydrate craving between these 2 groups (36+/-13 vs 33+/-15; P=NS).', 'title There is marked variability in weight loss achieved after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) with little ability to predict pre-operatively poor weight-loss outcomes. In this study, we categorize the patterns of post-operative weight loss after LRYGB by using a novel method of measurement based on the time to weight-loss steady state (SS). A bariatric database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent a LRYGB from 01/2001-12/2010. SS was defined as the month when the patient had ≤3% excess weight loss (%EWL) or weight gain from the prior visit. Percent total weight loss (%TWL) and %EWL were compared based on time to SS. The average time to SS was 15.5 months (n\\u2009=\\u2009178). A percentage of 7.3 of patients lost >5%EWL after achieving their SS weight. Patients with SS <12 months (n\\u2009=\\u200947) had a significantly lower %TWL and %EWL at SS and a 3-4-year follow-up compared to SS ≥12 months (n\\u2009=\\u2009131, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 for all). Initial weight loss velocity (IWLV) and body mass index (BMI) were not significantly associated with the time to SS.

The observed associations, however, are largely inconsistent. This meta-analysis of data from early-released studies was performed in an effort to determine the role of IVS1-397T>C in fracture. Relevant studies were searched through Pubmed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library databases. 16 studies meeting all selection criteria were finally identified. We calculated ORs with 95% CIs to assess risk of fracture. Subgroup analyses were performed by subtype, ethnicity and gender. Data on 2916 cases and 19170 controls were analyzed in the meta-analysis. Overall, we found moderately decreased risk in association with IVS1-397 CC genotype (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.73-0.92; OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.76-0.94). The decrease persisted in both hip fracture (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.71-0.94; OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.73-0.94) and vertebral fracture (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.50-0.91; OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.97; OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98) when data were stratified by subtype. We also found a significant trend of decreasing risk in relation to the CC genotype in Caucasian, male and female. All fixed-effects meta-analysis results were homogeneous.', 'title Controversy continues regarding the appropriate assessment of fracture risk in long bone lesions affected by disseminated malignancy. The purpose of this ongoing Musculoskeletal Tumor Society-sponsored, multi-institutional prospective cross-sectional clinical study is to compare CT-based structural rigidity analysis (CTRA) with physician-derived Mirels scoring for predicting pathologic fracture in femoral bone lesions. We hypothesized CTRA would be superior to Mirels in predicting fracture risk within the first year based on (1) sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value; (2) receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis; and (3) fracture prediction after controlling for potential confounding variables such as age and lesion size. Consented patients with femoral metastatic lesions were assigned Mirels scores by the individual enrolling orthopaedic oncologist based on plain radiographs and then underwent CT scans of both femurs with a phantom of known density. The CTRA was then performed. Between 2004 and 2008, six study centers performed CTRA on 125 patients. The general indications for this test were femoral metastatic lesions potentially at risk of fracture. The enrolling physician was allowed the choice of prophylactic stabilization or nonsurgical treatment, and the local treating oncology team along with the patient made this decision. Of those 125 patients, 78 (62%) did not undergo prophylactic stabilization and had followup sufficient for inclusion, which was fracture through the lesion within 12\\xa0months of CTRA, death within 12\\xa0months of CTRA, or 12-month survival after CTRA without fracture, whereas 15 (12%) were lost to followup and could not be studied here. The mean patient age was 61\\xa0years (SD, 14\\xa0years). There were 46 women. Sixty-four of the lesions were located in the proximal femur, 13 were in the diaphysis, and four were distal. Osteolytic lesions prevailed (48 lesions) over mixed (31 lesions) and osteoblastic (15 lesions). The most common primary cancers were breast (25 lesions), lung (14 lesions), and myeloma (11 lesions). CTRA was compared with Mirels based on sensitivity/specificity analysis, ROC, and fracture prediction by multivariate analysis. For the CTRA, reduction greater than 35% in axial, bending, or torsional rigidities at the lesion was considered at risk for fracture, whereas a Mirels score of 9 or above, as suggested in the original manuscript, was used as the definition of impending fracture. CTRA provided higher sensitivity (100% versus 66.7%), specificity (60.6% versus 47.9%), positive predictive value (17.6% versus 9.8%), and negative predictive value (100% versus 94.4%) compared with the classic Mirels definition of impending fracture (≥\\xa09), although there was considerable overlap in the confidence intervals. ROC curve analysis found CTRA to be better than the Mirels score regardless of what Mirels score cutoff was used. After controlling for potential confounding variables including age, lesion size, and Mirels scores, multivariable logistic regression indicated that CTRA was a better predictor of fracture (likelihood ratio test\\xa0=\\xa010.49, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001).', 'title Young adults with cystic fibrosis have compromised plate-like trabecular microstructure, altered axial alignment of trabeculae, and reduced connectivity between trabeculae that may contribute to the reduced bone strength and increased fracture risk observed in this patient population. The risk of fracture is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Individual trabecular segmentation (ITS)-based morphological analysis of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) images segments trabecular bone into individual plates and rods of different alignment and connectivity, which are important determinants of trabecular bone strength. We sought to determine whether alterations in ITS variables are present in patients with CF and may help explain their increased fracture risk. Thirty patients with CF ages 18-40\\xa0years underwent DXA scans of the hip and spine and HR-pQCT scans of the radius and tibia with further assessment of trabecular microstructure by ITS. These CF patients were compared with 60 healthy controls matched for age (±2\\xa0years), race, and gender. Plate volume fraction, thickness, and density as well as plate-plate and plate-rod connectivity were reduced, and axial alignment of trabeculae was lower in subjects with CF at both the radius and the tibia (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 for all). At the radius, adjustment for BMI eliminated most of these differences. At the tibia, however, reductions in plate volume fraction and number, axially aligned trabeculae, and plate-plate connectivity remained significant after adjustment for BMI alone and for BMI and aBMD (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 for all).', 'title This study tested the implication of pathologic fractures on the prognosis in stage IIb osteosarcoma. A single center retrospective evaluation of clinical management and oncologic outcome was conducted with 15 pathological fracture patients (M:F = 10:5; age: mean 23.2, range 12-42) and 50 non-fracture patients between April 2002 and December 2010. These stage IIB osteosarcoma patients were matched for age, tumor site (femur, tibia, and humerus), and osteosarcoma subtype (i.e., control patients with osteosarcoma in the same sites as the fracture patients). All osteosarcoma patients with pathological fractures underwent brace or cast immobilization, adjuvant chemotherapy, and limb salvage surgery or amputation.

Overall 3-year survival rates of the fracture and control groups (66.7% and 75.3%, respectively) were not statistically different (P = 0.5190).

Though trochanter stabilising plate (TSP) had been reported to have a good effect in preventing femoral medialization, its effects and indication in A2 fractures remain controversial. We hypothesized that TSP may improve treatment outcomes in patients with high risk of postoperative lateral femoral wall fractures. The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) the main risk factors predictive of PLWF in A2 fractures and, (2) whether TSP can improve treatment outcomes in patients with high risk of PLWF. Two hundred and fifty-two A2 fractures treated with DHS or DHS and TSP (DHS-TSP) during January 2000 and June 2013 were enrolled in this study. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine statistically significant risk factors for PLWF in 205 patients who were treated with DHS alone. The risk factor found to be associated with PLWF was utilized to include 171 patients who were at high risk of PLWF. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of TSP on treatment outcomes. Lateral wall thickness was found to be the main risk factor for PLWF in A2 fractures. A lateral wall thickness of 2.24 cm was found to be the best cutoff point to determine which patients were at high risk for PLWF. In 171 patients with a lateral wall thickness less than 2.24 cm, patients treated with DHS-TSP had significantly decreased lag screw sliding distances, PLWF rate, and reoperation rate (P=0.028, <0.001 and P=0.003, respectively) compared to the corresponding values of those treated with DHS alone. In the multivariate analysis, TSP decreased the reoperation rate by 13 times compared to that of patients who were treated with DHS alone.', 'title Fragility fractures are a growing worldwide health care problem. Hip fractures have been clearly associated with poor outcomes. Fragility fractures of other bones are common reasons for hospital admission and short-term disability, but specific long-term outcome studies of non-hip fragility fractures are rare. The aim of our trial was to evaluate the 1-year outcomes of non-hip fragility fracture patients. This study is a retrospective cohort review of 307 consecutive older inpatient non-hip fracture patients. Patient data for analysis included fracture location, comorbidity prevalence, pre-fracture functional status, osteoporosis treatments and sociodemographic characteristics. The main outcomes evaluated were 1-year mortality and post-fracture functional status. As compared to the expected mortality, the observed 1-year mortality was increased in the study group (17.6 vs. 12.2 %, P = 0.005). After logistic regression, three variables remained as independent risk factors for 1-year mortality among non-hip fracture patients: malnutrition (OR 3.3, CI 1.5-7.1), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.5) and the Parker Mobility Score (PMS) (OR 0.85, CI 0.74-0.98). CCI and PMS were independent risk factors for a high grade of dependency after 1 year.

Little is known about the impact of multiple myeloma on hip fracture care. We investigated whether the patients with multiple myeloma undergoing surgical treatment of hip fractures would be at increased risk for adverse outcomes versus patients who sustain a hip fracture without multiple myeloma. Using discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011), we identified 2 440 513 patients older than 50 years of age with surgically treated hip fractures. Of which, 4011 (0.2%) were found to have multiple myeloma. We compared perioperative outcomes between the patients with multiple myeloma and the nonmultiple myeloma patients using multivariable logistic regression modeling. Patients with multiple myeloma were more likely to have several postoperative complications, such as in-hospital pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.51), sepsis (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.32-2.25), surgical site infection (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.38-2.00), and acute renal failure (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.14-1.43).

We retrospectively analyzed 28 consecutive cases of pathologic fracture of primary high-grade localized osteosarcoma of extremities between June 1, 2001 and June 30, 2009. All patients underwent limb salvage surgery and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. They had a median age of 14 years (range, 6-30 years). The average follow-up time was 40.7 months (range, 9-108 months). Clinicopathological factors were analyzed in relation to pathologic fracture. Their recurrence and survival rates were compared to those in cohort of 171 osteosarcoma patients without pathologic fracture who underwent limb salvage surgery during the same period at the same institution. Less than 15 years, telangiectatic histological subtype, tumor located at the proximal humerus, and radiographical manifested as osteolytic features were risk factors in relation to pathologic fracture. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates were 50.5% and 45.4%, respectively, in the fracture group, and were not significantly different from those in the control group (71.0% and 61.9%, respectively). Of all 28 fracture patients, 4 experienced local recurrences (14.2%) and 14 developed distant metastasis (50%), which were not significantly different from the rates in the control group (8.8% and 37.4%, respectively).', \"title Hip fractures are mainly caused by accidental falls and trips, which magnify forces in well-defined areas of the proximal femur. Unfortunately, the same areas are at risk of rapid bone loss with ageing, since they are relatively stress-shielded during walking and sitting. Focal osteoporosis in those areas may contribute to fracture, and targeted 3D measurements might enhance hip fracture prediction. In the FEMCO case-control clinical study, Cortical Bone Mapping (CBM) was applied to clinical computed tomography (CT) scans to define 3D cortical and trabecular bone defects in patients with acute hip fracture compared to controls. Direct measurements of trabecular bone volume were then made in biopsies of target regions removed at operation. The sample consisted of CT scans from 313 female and 40 male volunteers (158 with proximal femoral fracture, 145 age-matched controls and 50 fallers without hip fracture). Detailed Cortical Bone Maps (c.5580 measurement points on the unfractured hip) were created before registering each hip to an average femur shape to facilitate statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Areas where cortical and trabecular bone differed from controls were visualised in 3D for location, magnitude and statistical significance. Measures from the novel regions created by the SPM process were then tested for their ability to classify fracture versus control by comparison with traditional CT measures of areal Bone Mineral Density (aBMD). In women we used the surgical classification of fracture location ('femoral neck' or 'trochanteric') to discover whether focal osteoporosis was specific to fracture type. To explore whether the focal areas were osteoporotic by histological criteria, we used micro CT to measure trabecular bone parameters in targeted biopsies taken from the femoral heads of 14 cases. Hip fracture patients had distinct patterns of focal osteoporosis that determined fracture type, and CBM measures classified fracture type better than aBMD parameters. CBM measures however improved only minimally on aBMD for predicting any hip fracture and depended on the inclusion of trabecular bone measures alongside cortical regions. Focal osteoporosis was confirmed on biopsy as reduced sub-cortical trabecular bone volume.\"]"

Four separate groups of hearts were stained with a bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor conjugated to fluorescein (fim, Teflabs) and PKC activity was measured. 2-NN reduced ischemia/reperfusion injury as evidenced by the enhanced myocardial functional recovery, decreased LDH release after reperfusion, and decreased reperfusion arrhythmias. The PKC inhibitor attenuated myocardial functional recovery but not reperfusion arrhythmias. Cyclic AMP levels decreased after 10 min of 2-NN perfusion, compared to controls. We observed an increase in PKC activity after 2-NN treatment.', \"title The adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel opener, diazoxide, preserves myocyte volume homeostasis and contractility during stress via an unknown mechanism. Pharmacologic overlap has been suggested between succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and KATP channel modulators. Diazoxide may be cardioprotective due to the inhibition of SDH which may form a portion of the mitochondrial KATP channel. To determine the role of inhibition of SDH in diazoxide's cardioprotection, this study utilized glutathione to prevent the inhibition of SDH. SDH activity was measured in isolated mitochondria exposed to succinate (control), malonate (inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase), diazoxide, and varying concentrations of glutathione alone or in combination with diazoxide. Enzyme activity was measured by spectrophotometric analysis. To evaluate myocyte volume and contractility, cardiac myocytes were superfused with Tyrode's physiologic solution (Tyrode's) (20 minutes), followed by test solution (20 minutes), including Tyrode's, hyperkalemic cardioplegia (stress), cardioplegia + diazoxide, cardioplegia + diazoxide + glutathione, or glutathione alone; followed by Tyrode's (20 minutes). Myocyte volume and contractility were recorded using image grabbing software. Both malonate and diazoxide inhibited succinate dehydrogenase. Glutathione prevented the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by diazoxide in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of diazoxide prevented the detrimental myocyte swelling due to cardioplegia alone and this benefit was lost with the addition of glutathione. However, glutathione elicited an independent cardioprotective effect on myocyte contractility.\", 'title The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels (K(+)-ATP channels) are activated by decreases in intracellular ATP and help to match blood flow to tissue needs. Such metabolism-flow coupling occurs predominantly in the smallest arterioles measuring 50 microm or less in diameter. Previous studies demonstrated that isoflurane may activate the K(+)-ATP channels in larger arteries. We examined whether isoflurane also activates the channels in the smallest arterioles of approximately 50 microm. Microvessels of approximately 50 microm were dissected from right atrial appendages from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery and were monitored in vitro for diameter changes by videomicroscopy. With or without preconstriction with the thromboxane analog U46619 1 microM, vessels were exposed to isoflurane 0%-3% either in the presence or absence of the K(+)-ATP channel blocker glibenclamide 1 microM. Without preconstriction, isoflurane neither dilated nor constricted the vessels significantly. After preconstriction, isoflurane had a concentration-dependent dilation of the small arterioles (39 +/- 13% [mean +/- SD] dilation at 3% isoflurane) (P < 0.001), and this effect was significantly attenuated by glibenclamide (18 +/- 5% dilation at 3% isoflurane) (P < 0.01). In comparison, nitroprusside 10(-4) M produced 79 +/- 6% dilation, and adenosine diphosphate 10(-4) M produced 29 +/- 7% dilation. We conclude that isoflurane-mediated dilation of the smallest resistance arterioles may be in part based on activation of the K(+)-ATP channels when the arterioles are relatively constricted.', 'title To study the role of Voltage-gated potassium ion channels (Kv) in cell proliferation and cell cycle of ovarian cancer cell. The effects of voltage-gate K+ channels on human ovarian cancer cell line (A2780 cell) proliferation and cell cycle were observed by means of MTT and flow cytometry. A variety of K+ channel blockers were used in order to differentiate the critical subtype of K+ channels involved. Mechanism of K+ channel in cell proliferation was explored by studying the relationship between the K+ channel and Ca2+ entry. Kv and L-type Ca2+ channel gene expressions were determined by RT-PCR. 4-Aminopyridine, an inhibitor of voltage-gated K+ channels, significantly inhibited the proliferation of A2780 cells as measured by MTT. 4-Aminopyridine also significantly affected the cell cycle, which increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1, and reduced the percentage of cells in S phase and G2/M phase. Non-selective K+ channel blockers tetrapentylammonium (TPeA) and verapamil had similar inhibitory effects on A2780 cell proliferation and cell cycle. In contrast, iberiotoxin, a selective inhibitor of KCa channels, and glibenclamide, a potent inhibitor of KATP channels, had no effect on the cell proliferation and cell cycle of A2780. Moreover K+ channels inhibitor, TPeA and verapamil, can blocked Ca2+ influx in these cells.', 'title The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP)) opener nicorandil used instead of potassium in hypothermic cardioplegia significantly improves preservation of cardiac function and energetics in the in situ heart preparation. The present study, therefore, examines the effect of nicorandil at different temperatures and the role of sarcolemmal and mitochondrial K(ATP) channels under ex vivo conditions using contractile force (CF) and action potential duration (APD) as end points. Guinea-pig papillary muscles at 37, 27, or 22 degrees C (1Hz) were exposed to nicorandil 0.2-1.1 mM. The contributions of K(ATP) channel subtypes in cardioprotection were examined using mitochondrial (mito) (0.1 mM) or non-selective (1.0 mM) concentrations of nicorandil, mito K(ATP) blocker 5-hydroxyl decanoate (5HD, 300 microM) or sarcolemmal (sarc) K(ATP) blocker HMR1098 (30 microM) before and during 140 min of hypothermic (22 degrees C) glucose-free hypoxia. Nicorandil >0.5 mM shortened the APD, and this was abolished by hypothermia and HMR1098 but not by 5HD. Nicorandil in both tested concentrations preserved contractile force after hypoxia-reoxygenation significantly better than control (73.7+/-4.4% and 75.8+/-3.9% vs 40.6+/-2.6%, n=6 in each group). Protection was blocked by 5HD but not by HMR1098. 5HD and HMR1098 alone did not change recovery of contractile force compared to control.', 'title Mitochondrial calcium sensitive potassium (mK(Ca)) channels are involved in cardioprotection induced by ischemic preconditioning. In the present study we investigated whether morphine-induced preconditioning also involves activation of mK(Ca) channels. Isolated rat hearts (six groups; each n = 8) underwent global ischemia for 30 min followed by a 60-min reperfusion. Control animals were not further treated. Morphine preconditioning (MPC) was initiated by two five-minute cycles of morphine 1 microM infusion with one five-minute washout and one final ten-minute washout period before ischemia. The mK(Ca) blocker, paxilline 1 microM, was administered, with and without morphine administration (MPC + Pax and Pax). As a positive control, we added an ischemic preconditioning group (IPC) alone and combined with paxilline (IPC + Pax). At the end of reperfusion, infarct sizes were determined by triphenyltetrazoliumchloride staining. Infarct size was (mean +/- SD) 45 +/- 9% of the area at risk in the Control group. The infarct size was less in the morphine or ischemic preconditioning groups (MPC: 23 +/- 8%, IPC: 20 +/- 5%; each P < 0.05 vs Control). Infarct size reduction was abolished by paxilline (MPC + Pax: 37 +/- 7%, P < 0.05 vs MPC and IPC + Pax: 36 +/- 6%, P < 0.05 vs IPC), whereas paxilline alone had no effect (Pax: 46 +/- 7%, not significantly different from Control).', 'title Potassium (K(+)) channels are key regulators of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) excitability. In systemic small arteries, Kv7 channel expression/activity has been noted and a role in vascular tone regulation demonstrated. We aimed to demonstrate functional Kv7 channels in human fetoplacental small arteries. Human placental chorionic plate arteries (CPAs) were obtained at term. CPA responses to Kv7 channel modulators was determined by wire myography. Presence of Kv7 channel mRNA (encoded by KCNQ1-5) and protein expression were assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, respectively. Kv7 channel blockade with linopirdine increased CPA basal tone and AVP-induced contraction. Pre-contracted CPAs (AVP; 80 mM K(+) depolarization solution) exhibited significant relaxation to flupirtine, retigabine, the acrylamide (S)-1, and (S) BMS-204352, differential activators of Kv7.1 - Kv7.5 channels. All CPAs assessed expressed KCNQ1 and KCNQ3-5 mRNA; KCNQ2 was expressed only in a subset of CPAs. Kv7 protein expression was confirmed in intact CPAs and isolated VSMCs.', 'title To investigate the role of oxidative stress in impaired intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels (IKCa)- and small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels (SKCa)-mediated relaxation in diabetic resistance arteries. Rat diabetic model was induced by a high fat and high glucose diet and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Endothelial function of mesenteric arteries was assessed with the use of wire myography. The expression levels of IKCa and SKCa in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with H2O2 and/or antioxidant alpha lipoic acid (ALA) were measured using Western blotting. IKCa- and SKCa-mediated vasodilatation in response to acetylcholine was impaired in the third-order mesenteric arterioles of diabetic rats. In cultured HUVECs, H2O2 significantly decreased the protein expression of IKCa and SKCa. ALA alleviated the impairment of both vasodilatation function of the mesenteric arterioles ex vivo and enhanced the expression of IKCa and SKCa challenged with H2O2 in cultured HUVECs.', 'title We analyzed the gestational changes of pharmacological activity and molecular levels of KATP channels in rat myometrium. Using rat myometrium, the effects of K+ channel openers (KCOs) were examined in an isometric tension study of oxytocin-induced contraction. We also examined the effects of KCOs on the intracellular Ca2+ levels of cultured myometrial cells. The expression of myometrial KATP channels was assessed by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. The effect of KCOs were altered during pregnancy, with a significant increase of their potency at day 18 of pregnancy followed by a decline towards the non-pregnant level at the day of delivery. KCOs suppressed the Ca2+ influx across the cell membrane. The mRNAs encoding each component of myometrial KATP channels, Kir6.1 and SUR2B, exhibited gestational stage-dependent alterations similar to those of the effects of KCOs.', 'title Human cultured prostatic stromal cells respond to protein kinase G (PKG) activators and the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP) channels) to reduce nifedipine-sensitive phorbol ester-induced contractility. PKG activators, SNP, diazoxide, nifedipine, isoprenaline, forskolin, and Sp-8-Br-cAMP were used to inhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-induced contractions in tissue from transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP). The selective K(ATP) and large conductance Ca(2+) activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channel inhibitors, glibenclamide and charybdotoxin, respectively were used to inhibit responses to PKG activators. RT-PCR identified the K(ATP) channel subunits present in TURP tissue and cultured cells. The PKG activators, APT-cGMP (1 nM-100 microM) and PET-cGMP (1 nM-100 microM), and also SNP (1 nM-100 microM), forskolin (10 microM), diazoxide (100 microM) and nifedipine (3 microM) inhibited phenylephrine (20 microM)-induced contractions. The effect of APT-cGMP (1 nM-100 microM) could be reversed by glibenclamide, but not by charybdotoxin. TURP tissue contained mRNA for PKG Ialpha, Ibeta, and II and the K(ATP) channel subunits Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR2B, and SUR1. Cultured stromal cells contained only Kir6.1 and SUR2B subunit mRNA. SUR1 mRNA was detected in one of five cultured epithelial cell lines.']"

Recent studies indicate a key role for circulating FABP4 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. We described an additional role for FABP4 in the development of cardiac dysfunction in obesity. Therefore, FABP4 seems to be a target in the prevention and treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in obesity with high potential for future therapeutic applications. However, a safe pharmacological therapy is not yet available. Lipoprotein apheresis is an established therapy for severe and otherwise untreatable hypercholesterolemia which increases life expectancy in patients at high-risk for cardiovascular events. We therefore investigated the acute effect of lipoprotein apheresis on FABP4 serum levels in 64 high-risk patients (25 women, 39 men) under regular apheresis treatment. FABP4 levels were significantly reduced by 23.2 ± 1.8% by apheresis treatment. Although women had higher FABP4 levels than men (53.5 ± 8.3 ng/ml vs. 30.7 ± 4.3 ng/ml), reduction rate after lipoprotein apheresis was similar in both genders. Among the apheresis methods investigated, immunoadsorption of lipoproteins was most effective in lowering circulating FABP4.', 'title Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) is abundantly expressed in adipocytes and plays a role in glucose homeostasis. We analysed the relationship between serum FABP4 levels and the progression of metabolic syndrome in healthy adults. A total of 465 subjects were selected from participants in a medical check-up programme at a Health Promotion Center. Baseline serum FABP4 levels were measured, and the subjects were evaluated for the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) according to the recommendations of the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The subjects were re-evaluated 4 years later. Baseline FABP4 concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with MetS than in those without MetS (P<0.001). At the 4-year follow-up, subjects in the highest FABP4 tertile at baseline exhibited higher values for body mass index, fat mass and percent body fat, as well as blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels (all P<0.05). The subjects with higher FABP4 levels had lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations (P<0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, change in percent body fat and baseline values for other metabolic and inflammatory parameters, FABP4 levels at baseline were shown to be strongly associated with the development of MetS by year 4 (odds ratio (OR), 5.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71-12.23 for highest tertile vs. lowest tertile, P<0.001)', 'title Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/A-FABP/aP2) is expressed in not only adipocytes and macrophages but also peritubular capillaries in the normal kidney. We recently demonstrated that ectopic expression of FABP4, but not FABP1 known as liver FABP (L-FABP), in the glomerulus is associated with progression of proteinuria and renal dysfunction. However, urinary excretion of FABP4 has not been investigated. Subjects who participated in the Tanno-Sobetsu Study, a study with a population-based cohort design, in 2011 (n\\u200a=\\u200a392, male/female: 166/226) were enrolled. Urinary FABP4 (U-FABP4) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured. Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was followed up one year later. In 93 (23.7%) of the 392 subjects, U-FABP4 level was below the sensitivity of the assay. Subjects with undetectable U-FABP4 were younger and had lower UACR and higher eGFR levels than subjects with measurable U-FABP4. U-FABP4 level was positively correlated with age, systolic blood pressure and levels of serum FABP4 (S-FABP4), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), urinary FABP1 (U-FABP1) and UACR (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.360, p<0.001). Age, S-FABP4, U-FABP1 and UACR were independent predictors of U-FABP4. On the other hand, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c and U-FABP4 were independently correlated with UACR.

Recent studies have shown that FABP4 is secreted from adipocytes and that FABP4 level is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the impact of FABP4 concentrations on prognosis. We tested the hypothesis that FABP4 level predicts prognosis of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a group at high risk for atherosclerosis-associated morbidity and mortality. Biochemical markers including FABP4 were determined in 61 ESRD patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD). Serum FABP4 level in females (404.2±30.5 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that in males (315.8±30.0 ng/ml), and the levels in ESRD patients were about 20-times higher than those in age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects with normal renal function. FABP4 level was decreased by 57.2% after HD and was positively correlated with blood pressure, BMI, and levels of lipids and insulin. Multiple regression analysis indicated that HD duration, BMI, and triglycerides level were independent determinants for FABP4 level. ESRD patients with high FABP4 levels had higher cardiovascular mortality during the 7-year follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that logarithmically transformed FABP4 level was an independent predictor of cardiovascular death adjusted for age, gender, HD duration, BMI, and triglycerides level (hazard ratio, 7.75; 95% CI, 1.05-25.31).', 'title Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is expressed in adipocytes, and elevated plasma FABP4 level is associated with obesity-mediated metabolic phenotype. Postprandial regulation and secretory signaling of FABP4 has been investigated. Time courses of FABP4 levels were examined during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; n=53) or a high-fat test meal eating (n=35). Effects of activators and inhibitors of adenyl cyclase (AC)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and guanylyl cyclase (GC)-protein kinase G (PKG) signaling on FABP4 secretion from mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. FABP4 level significantly declined after the OGTT or a high-fat meal eating, while insulin level was increased. Treatment with low and high glucose concentration or palmitate for 2 h did not affect FABP4 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. FABP4 secretion was increased by stimulation of lipolysis using isoproterenol, a β3 -adrenoceptor agonist (CL316243), forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP and atrial natriuretic peptide, and the induced FABP4 secretion was suppressed by insulin or an inhibitor of PKA (H-89), PKG (KT5823) or hormone sensitive lipase (CAY10499).', 'title Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, and elevated circulating FABP4 level is associated with obesity-mediated metabolic phenotype. We systematically investigated roles of FABP4 in the development of coronary artery atherosclerosis. First, by immunohistochemical analyses, we found that FABP4 was expressed in macrophages within coronary atherosclerotic plaques and epicardial/perivascular fat in autopsy cases and macrophages within thrombi covering ruptured coronary plaques in thrombectomy samples from patients with acute myocardial infarction. Second, we confirmed that FABP4 was secreted from macrophages and adipocytes cultured in vitro. Third, we investigated the effect of exogenous FABP4 on macrophages and human coronary artery-derived smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in vitro. Treatment of the cells with recombinant FABP4 significantly increased gene expression of inflammatory markers in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we measured serum FABP4 level in the aortic root (Ao-FABP4) and coronary sinus (CS-FABP4) of 34 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. Coronary stenosis score assessed by the modified Gensini score was weakly correlated with CS-FABP4 but was not correlated with Ao-FABP4. A stronger correlation (r=0.59, P<0.01) was observed for the relationship between coronary stenosis score and coronary veno-arterial difference in FABP4 level, (CS-Ao)-FABP4, indicating local production of FABP4 during coronary circulation in the heart. Multivariate analysis indicated that (CS-Ao)-FABP4 was an independent predictor of the severity of coronary stenosis after adjustment of conventional risk factors.', \"title Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is expressed in both adipocytes and macrophages.

Case-control study with a prospective follow-up of cases for 2 years in our referral pediatric endocrine outpatient center. Seventy-three prepubertal obese children, 8.03 ± 1.08-years old, and 47 age- and gender-matched lean controls were studied. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, fasting oral glucose tolerance test, homeostatic model insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, lipocalin-2, and A-FABP were evaluated. Weight loss was considered if z-score body mass index (BMI) decreased at least 0.5 s.d. At baseline, lipocalin-2 and A-FABP were higher in prepubertal obese children than those in lean controls (P<0.001). A-FABP showed a gradual increase, according to the obesity degree (r(2)=0.632; P<0.001).

We analyzed circulating levels of FABP4 in 81 Spanish women: 38 lean (body mass index (BMI)<25\\u200akg/m(2)) and 43 morbidly obese (BMI>40\\u200akg/m(2)). We took 30 follow-up blood samples at 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery. We assessed FABP4 gene expression in samples of subcutaneous abdominal and visceral adipose tissue. Adipose tissue mRNA expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. In morbidly obese women, plasma FABP4 levels were significantly higher than in non-obese patients. These levels positively correlated with BMI, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), and plasma glucose and insulin levels. Post-operative FABP4 levels decreased by a maximum of 30% after 12 months. We also found an inverse association between FABP4 and adiponectin levels, and positive correlations between FABP4 and circulating leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 levels. Linear regression analysis revealed that FABP4 was more closely related to HOMA2-IR than adiponectin, CRP, TNF-RI, or leptin. Furthermore, high circulating FABP4 levels were associated with the presence of MS. FABP4 mRNA expression in visceral adipose tissue was related to its circulating levels in morbidly obese women.']"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ghrelin on angiogenic response using in vivo angiogenesis assay of matrigel plug and its correlation with serum leptin levels in normal and diet-induced obese mice. This experimental study has been done on 24 male C57BL/6 mice which were randomly divided into four groups: Normal diet (ND) or control, ND + ghrelin, high-fat-diet (HFD) or obese and HFD + ghrelin (n = 6/group). Obese and control groups received HFD or standard diet for 14 weeks. Then, growth factor reduced matrigel plug (500 μl) containing bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor; 100 ng) with or without ghrelin (100 μg/kg) was injected subcutaneously in the mid-ventral abdominal region of each mice. After 10 days, blood samples were taken and matrigel plugs were removed under anesthesia and angiogenic response was assessed by immunohisochemical staining. HFD significantly increased angiogenesis in matrigel plug as expressed as the number of CD31-positive cells than standard diet (43 ± 5 vs. 13 ± 2.5 CD31(+) cells/field). Ghrelin did not alter angiogenesis in matrigel plug in both obese and control groups. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of CD31-positive cells and serum leptin concentration (r = 0.91).', 'title Low adiponectin, a well-recognized antidiabetic adipokine, has been associated with obesity-related inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Globular adiponectin is an important regulator of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/NFκB pathway in monocytes of obese subjects. It protects against inflammation and oxidative stress by inducing IRAK3. microRNA (miR)-146b-5p inhibits NFκB-mediated inflammation by targeted repression of IRAK1 and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6). Therefore, we measured the expression of miR-146b-5p in monocytes of obese subjects. Because it was low we determined the involvement of this miR in the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and insulin signaling action of globular adiponectin. miR-146b-5p expression in monocytes of obese subjects was determined by qRT-PCR. The effect of miR-146b-5p silencing on molecular markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin signaling and the association with globular adiponectin was assessed in human THP-1 monocytes. miR-146b-5p was downregulated in monocytes of obese persons. Low globular adiponectin decreased miR-146b-5p and IRAK3 in THP-1 monocytes, associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) protein were unchanged. Silencing of miR-146b-5p with an antisense inhibitor resulted in increased expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 leading to more NFκB p65 DNA binding activity and TNFα. As a response IRAK3 and IRS1 protein increased. Mitochondrial and intracellular ROS production did not increase despite more inflammation. In addition, exposure of miR-146b-5p-depleted THP-1 monocytes to high levels of globular adiponectin resulted in an increased production of TNFα and intracellular ROS. Still, they did not lose their potential to increase IRAK3 and IRS1 protein and to decrease mitochondrial ROS.', 'title Adipose tissue releases adipokines that play important roles in metabolic and cardio-cerebro-vascular homeostasis. This study was to discover novel adipokines using caloric restriction model. Adipokine candidates were captured by gene array and bioinformatics analysis and verified by preparation of recombinant protein and antibody. We established a potential secreted protein database containing 208 genes and identified a novel adipokine, Subfatin, that was the highest expressed in subcutaneous fat of both rodents and humans among 15 detected tissues. The secreted mammalian Subfatin was a glycosylated protein. Subfatin was located diffusely throughout the adipose tissue except lipid droplets, with comparable expression between adipocytes and stromal cells, but much lower expression in macrophages than adipocytes. Subfatin was downregulated in white adipose tissue of caloric restriction rats, whereas dramatically upregulated during white adipocyte differentiation as well as in white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice. Subfatin was annotated as Meteorin-like (Metrnl) in public databases, a similar transcript of Meteorin (Metrn, also known as glial cell differentiation regulator). Meteorin displayed a brain-specific expression and was scarce in various adipose tissues, in contrast to the tissue expression patterns of Subfatin.', 'title To investigate the impact of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha deficiency on gene expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and the glycerol transporter aquaglyceroporin 7 in white adipose tissue in the fed and fasted states in relation to glycerol release by isolated adipocytes. Studies using wild-type and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha null mice. Hormone and metabolite concentrations, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), basal and stimulated adipocyte lipolysis, estimated by glycerol release. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha deficiency blocked the increase in aquaglyceroporin 7 transcript level and attenuated the increase in adipose triglyceride lipase transcript level in white adipose tissue elicited by fasting. Fasting glycerol levels were lower in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha null than wild-type mice, despite increased mobilization of adipocyte fat reserves in vivo as indicated by reduced adipose tissue masses (three distinct depots) and a significantly lower epididymal adipocyte diameter. Basal net glycerol release was unchanged but beta-adrenergic-stimulated net glycerol release was higher with isolated adipocytes from fasted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha null mice compared with those of fasted wild-type mice.', 'title A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and metabolism is important for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity and its complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. A complex role for prostaglandins (PGs) in adipogenesis is suggested. We examined the expression and cellular localization of enzymes in the cyclooxygenase (COX) cascade that synthesize PGs as well as the PG profile as a function of differentiation status in 3T3-L1 cells. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used as a model for studies of adipocyte differentiation induced by a hormone cocktail and compared with the parental fibroblastic line NIH 3T3. Both cell lines were incubated in maintenance medium or differentiation medium. Nine days after differentiation, the expression of enzymes in the COX cascade was evaluated by immunoblot analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry, and PG formation was examined using enzyme immunoassay. A differentiation-dependent diminution of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and cognate proteins in 3T3-L1 cells was observed. PG release, including PGE(2), 6-keto PGF(1alpha), PGD(2) and 15d-PGJ(2), significantly decreased following differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells (anova/Tukey, p < 0.05). However, microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES) and lipocalin-type PGD synthase (L-PGDS) were selectively upregulated. Immunocytochemistry revealed that COX-1 and COX-2 became intracellularly more diffuse upon differentiation, whereas mPGES was redistributed to the nuclear compartment.', 'title It is believed that adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ by producing inflammatory mediators and thereby contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk seen in obesity. A link between adipose tissue mass and angiogenesis has been suggested. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to be implicated in this process. Members of the glycoprotein (gp)130 ligand family regulate VEGF expression in other cells. We used tissue explants as well as primary cultures of preadipocytes and adipocytes from human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue to investigate whether the gp130 ligands oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) regulate VEGF expression in human adipose tissue. Human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue responded to treatment with IL-6 and OSM with a significant increase in VEGF production. Human preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Adipocyte-differentiation was induced by hormone-supplementation. All cell types responded to IL-6 and OSM with a robust increase in VEGF protein production and a similar increase in VEGF-specific mRNA. Furthermore, IL-1beta synergistically enhanced the effect of OSM on VEGF production. AG-490, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, abolished the OSM-dependent VEGF induction almost completely. In mice, IL-6 and OSM increased serum levels of VEGF and VEGF mRNA and vessel density in adipose tissue.', 'title Levels of the vascular peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) are significantly elevated in obesity. Adipose tissue-derived ET-1 attenuates insulin-mediated antilipolysis in human visceral adipocytes through the activation of the ET receptor B (ET(B)R), thereby linking ET-1 to insulin resistance. Whether ET-1 has direct effects on lipolysis in human adipocytes is not known. Endothelin-1 receptor (ETR) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR in 130 non-obese and obese subjects. ET-1 mRNA in different adipose tissue regions was also assessed. ETR protein expression was analyzed by western blotting in 37 subjects. The effect of ET-1 on lipolysis was assessed in freshly isolated adipocytes and in vitro differentiated adipocytes from human donors. Freshly isolated human adipocytes incubated with different concentrations of ET-1 showed no acute effect on lipolysis. In contrast, a 24 h incubation in primary cultures of human adipocytes resulted in a significant 50% increase in lipolysis. This effect was concentration dependent and could be mimicked by an agonist of the ET(A) receptor but not with a selective ET(B)R agonist. Adipocyte differentiation was not affected by any of the agonists. In subcutaneous (s.c.) adipose tissue from 19 non-obese and 18 obese subjects, the protein expression of ET(A)R was significantly higher in obese subjects whereas there was no difference in ET(B)R expression. Interestingly, the differences in protein expression were not observed at the mRNA level as ET(A)R expression was similar between lean and obese subjects.', 'title To determine whether adipocyte enhancer binding protein (AEBP) 1, a transcriptional repressor that is down-regulated during adipogenesis, functions as a critical regulator of adipose tissue homeostasis through modulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) tumor suppressor activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. We examined whether AEBP1 physically interacts with PTEN in 3T3-L1 cells by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. We generated AEBP1-null mice and examined the physiological role of AEBP1 as a key modulator of in vivo adiposity. Using adipose tissue from wild-type and AEBP1-null animals, we examined whether AEBP1 affects PTEN protein level. AEBP1 interacts with PTEN, and deficiency of AEBP1 increases adipose tissue PTEN mass. AEBP1-null mice have reduced adipose tissue mass and enhanced apoptosis with suppressed survival signal. Primary pre-adipocytes from AEBP1-null adipose tissues exhibit lower basal MAPK activity with defective proliferative potential. AEBP1-null mice are also resistant to diet-induced obesity, suggesting a regulatory role for AEBP1 in energy homeostasis.', 'title The roles of the angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor in the changes in white adipose tissue were explored in an animal model of atherosclerosis using apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoEKO) mice. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoEKO) mice and KK-A(y) mice were used. Expression of markers for adipocyte differentiation and inflammation was determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Adipose tissue weight and adipocyte size in epididymal white adipose tissue were increased in ApoEKO mice and KK-A(y) mice. In the adipose tissue of these models, expression of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), which induce adipocyte differentiation, and expression of transcription factors of adipocyte differentiation, such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) and aP2, were decreased. Expression of inflammatory markers and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunits was also increased. Deletion of AT(1)a receptor in ApoEKO mice and administration of an AT(1) receptor blocker, valsartan, to KK-A(y) mice reduced epididymal adipose tissue weight and adipocyte size significantly. Blockade of the AT(1) receptor also reduced the expression of inflammatory chemokines and oxidative stress markers. Moreover, AT(1)a receptor deletion in ApoEKO mice and AT(1) receptor blockade in KK-A(y) mice prevented the decrease in expression of adiponectin, PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and aP2. Valsartan also increased glucose uptake induced by insulin in adipose tissue of KK-A(y) mice.', \"title The increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the decrease in adiponectin production from hypertrophic adipocytes are associated with adipose tissue inflammation and its metabolic complications. The aim of this study was to determine whether 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, modulates these adipocytokine productions in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-treated adipocytes. AICAR and/or other reagents were added to the culture medium, and then, TNFα was added to fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The MCP-1 and adiponectin production in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. AMPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activities were also assayed. Treatment with TNFα increased MCP-1 and decreased adiponectin secretion dose-dependently in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and AICAR significantly inhibited these TNFα-mediated changes. Interestingly, metformin, another AMPK activator, did not have such effects on these adipocytokines. Both the AMPK and PI3K systems in the cells were significantly activated by the AICAR treatment, but the effects of AICAR on adipocytokines were not weakened by the addition of dorsomorphin, an AMPK inhibitor, or LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-κB inhibitor, showed protective effects similar to those as AICAR. AICAR, but not metformin, significantly inhibited the TNFα-stimulated activation of NF-κB, and dorsomorphin did not change AICAR's effect.\"]"

Recent studies have shown that plasma omentin-1 levels decrease with obesity. Currently, no data exist on the relative expression and regulation of omentin-1 in adipose tissue of women with PCOS. The objective of this study was to assess mRNA and protein levels of omentin-1, including circulating omentin-1, in omental adipose tissue of women with PCOS and matched control subjects. Ex vivo and in vivo regulation of adipose tissue omentin-1 was also studied. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to assess mRNA and protein expression of omentin-1. Plasma omentin-1 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of d-glucose, insulin, and gonadal and adrenal steroids on adipose tissue omentin-1 were analyzed ex vivo.

Plasma adiponectin and parameters of obesity, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism were measured In 62 women with PCOS and in 35 healthy female controls. Both in PCOS and controls, adiponectin levels were lower in overweight or obese women than in normal-weight women, without any difference between PCOS and controls after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). In PCOS and in controls there was a significant correlation of adiponectin with BMI (r = -0.516, P < 0.001), fasting insulin (r = -0.404, P < 0.001), homeostasis model sensitivity (HOMA %S) (r = -0.424, P < 0.001) and testosterone (r = -0.279, P < 0.01), but no correlation with androstenedione (r = -0.112, P = 0.325), 17-OH-progesterone (r =-0.031, P = 0.784) or the LH/FSH ratio (r =-0.033, P = 0.753). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that BMI and HOMA %S but not testosterone were independently associated with adiponectin plasma levels, explaining 16% (BMI) and 13% (HOMA %S) of the variability of adiponectin, respectively. In PCOS patients insulin sensitivity, as indicated by continuous infusion of glucose with model assessment (CIGMA %S) was significantly correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.55; P < 0.001), BMI (r =-0.575; P < 0.001), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r =-0.48; P = 0.001), body fat mass assessed by dual-energy X-ray-absorptiometry (DEXA) [Dexa-fat (total) (r = -0.61; P < 0.001) and Dexa-fat (trunk) (r = -0.59; P < 0.001)] and with testosterone (r = -0.42; P = 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that markers of obesity such as BMI, total or truncal fat mass, age and adiponectin were independently associated with CIGMA %S, and that circulating adiponectin accounted for about 18% of the degree of insulin resistance in PCOS. By contrast, testosterone was not a significant factor, suggesting that PCOS per se did not affect insulin sensitivity independent from obesity, age and adiponectin.

We investigated oxidative-related alterations in erythrocytes and anti-inflammatory effects of inositol in women with PCOS before and after treatment with myo-inositol (MYO). Twenty-six normal-weight PCOS patients were investigated before and after MYO administration (1200 mg/day for 12 weeks; n=18) or placebo (n=8) by evaluating serum testosterone, serum androstenedione, fasting serum insulin, fasting serum glucose, insulin area under the curve (AUC), and glucose AUC after oral glucose tolerance test and homeostasis model of assessment-IR. In erythrocytes, band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) level, glutathione (GSH) content, and glutathionylated proteins (GSSP) were also assessed. Data show that PCOS patients' erythrocytes underwent oxidative stress as indicated by band 3 Tyr-P values, reduced cytosolic GSH content, and increased membrane protein glutathionylation. MYO treatment significantly improved metabolic and biochemical parameters. Significant reductions were found in IR and serum values of androstenedione and testosterone. A significant association between band 3 Tyr-P levels and insulin AUC was found at baseline but disappeared after MYO treatment, while a correlation between band 3 Tyr-P and testosterone levels was detected both before and after MYO treatment.\", 'title To investigate the correlation between insulin resistance (IR) and serum 25-OH-Vit D concentrations and hormonal parameters in lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 50 lean women with PCOS and 40 body mass index (BMI) matched controls were compared in terms of fasting insulin and glucose, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 25-OH-Vit D, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and Ferriman-Gallway (FG) scores. Correlation analyses were performed between HOMA-IR and metabolic and endocrine parameters. 30% of patients with PCOS demonstrated IR. Levels of 25-OH-Vit D, hsCRP, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride and fasting glucose did not differ between the study and control groups. Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, LH, total testosterone, and DHEA-S levels were higher in PCOS group.

Insulin-sensitizing agents have been shown to improve both reproductive and metabolic aspects of PCOS, but it remains unclear whether it is also beneficial in lean patients without pre-treatment IR. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of metformin on the clinical and biochemical parameters of PCOS irrespective of the presence of basal obesity and IR. The effect of 6 months of metformin treatment was prospectively assessed in 188 PCOS patients, divided into three groups according to body mass index (BMI; lean: BMI<25 kg/m2, overweight: BMI 25-29 kg/m2, and obese: BMI30 kg/m2). Outcome parameters, which were also assessed in 102 healthy controls, included body weight, homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose and insulin levels, area under the curve of insulin response (AUCI), hyperandrogenism, and menstrual irregularities. In comparison with the respective BMI-appropriate control groups, only obese but not lean and overweight PCOS patients showed differences in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. Metformin therapy significantly improved all outcome parameters except fasting glucose levels. Subgroup analyses revealed that in the group of lean PCOS patients without pre-treatment IR, metformin significantly improved HOMA-IR (1.7+/-1.0 vs 1.1+/-0.7 micromol/lxmmol/l2) and fasting insulin levels (7.7+/-4.2 vs 5.4+/-3.9 mU/l), in addition to testosterone levels (2.6+/-0.9 vs 1.8+/-0.7 nmol/l), anovulation rate (2.3 vs 59.5%), and acne (31.8 vs 11.6%; all P<0.017). In the overweight and obese PCOS groups, metformin also showed the expected beneficial effects.', 'title Abdominal adiposity and obesity influence the association of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with insulin resistance and diabetes. We aimed to characterize the intermediate metabolism phenotypes associated with PCOS and obesity. We applied a nontargeted GC-MS metabolomic approach to plasma samples from 36 patients with PCOS and 39 control women without androgen excess, matched for age, body mass index, and frequency of obesity. Patients with PCOS were hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant compared with the controls. The increase in plasma long-chain fatty acids, such as linoleic and oleic acid, and glycerol in the obese patients with PCOS suggests increased lipolysis, possibly secondary to impaired insulin action at adipose tissue. Conversely, nonobese patients with PCOS showed a metabolic profile consisting of suppression of lipolysis and increased glucose utilization (increased lactic acid concentrations) in peripheral tissues, and PCOS patients as a whole showed decreased 2-ketoisocaproic and alanine concentrations, suggesting utilization of branched-chain amino acids for protein synthesis and not for gluconeogenesis. These metabolic processes required effective insulin signaling; therefore, insulin resistance was not universal in all tissues of these women, and different mechanisms possibly contributed to their hyperinsulinemia. PCOS was also associated with decreased α-tocopherol and cholesterol concentrations irrespective of obesity.', \"title Despite the very high prevalence of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the underlying pathogenetic mechanism has remained obscure. To determine the cause of two sisters' PCOS associated with severe insulin resistance. Clinical case report. Methods Two sisters who presented with hyperandrogenism and menstrual disorders in the context of PCOS, and were subsequently found to be severely insulin resistant. Physical examination revealed muscular hypertrophy with a paucity of fat in the extremities, trunk and gluteal regions, in spite of excess fat deposits in the face, neck and dorsocervical region. Known genes involved in familial partial lipodystrophy were screened. At the same time, metformin (1700 mg/day) was commenced. After 2-3 years of uninterrupted therapy, lack of clinical improvement led to the introduction of pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Both sisters were found to be heterozygous for the R482Q mutation in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) gene, establishing the definitive diagnosis as Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy complicated by severe insulin resistance and secondary PCOS. Treatment with pioglitazone resulted in progressive amelioration of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenaemia. Menses also improved, with restoration of a eumenorrhoeic pattern, and the framework of ultrasound PCO was in complete remission.\"]"

We aimed to elucidate the genetic bases of diabetes associated with obesity (diabesity), and to analyse the impact of corpulence on the effects of diabetes susceptibility genes. We genotyped known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the adiponectin-encoding adipocyte C1q and collagen-domain-containing (ACDC) gene (-11,391G>A, -11,377C>G, +45T>G and +276G>T), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) Pro12Ala SNP and ACDC exon 3 variants in 703 French morbidly obese subjects (BMI 47.6+/-7.4 kg/m(2)), 808 non-obese subjects (BMI<30 kg/m(2)) and 493 obese subjects (30< or =BMI<40 kg/m(2)). Two 5\\'-ACDC SNPs -11,391G>A, -11,377C>G were associated with adiponectin levels (p=0.0003, p=0.008) and defined a \"low-level\" haplotype associated with decreased adiponectin levels (p=0.0002) and insulin sensitivity (p=0.01) and with a risk of type 2 diabetes that was twice as high (p=0.002).

It was recently described that GHBP directly depends on serum leptin levels. Since leptin co-varies with insulin secretion and/or sensitivity, we aimed to study the influence of these variables on plasma GHBP activity. In order to isolate the effects of obesity per se from those of insulin secretion, three groups of subjects were prospectively studied: 14 lean, 10 obese and nine obese subjects with glucose intolerance. The percentage of body fat was measured through bioelectric impedance. Insulin sensitivity and secretion were determined through a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis. Serum leptin was measured by radioimmunoassay. GHBP activity was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography-gel filtration method. Plasma GHBP activity was found to correlate with BMI (r = 0. 65, P < 0.0001), fat mass (r = 0.51, P = 0.003), waist circumference (r = 0.64, P < 0.0001), waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.42, P = 0.01), insulin sensitivity (SI, r = - 0.61, P = 0.0001), insulin secretion (expressed as the acute insulin response to intravenous glucose, AIRg) (r = 0.48, P = 0.006) and leptin concentration (r = 0.49, P = 0.004). The associations with SI (r = - 0.42, P = 0.02) and AIRg (r = 0.38, P = 0.03) persisted even after controlling for fat mass. Since insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity usually covary in glucose tolerant subjects (an increased insulin secretion is necessary to compensate a decreased insulin sensitivity), we constructed a multiple linear regression to predict GHBP activity. In this model, SI (P = 0.005), AIRg (P = 0.02) and SD score-leptin (P = 0.03) independently contributed to 34, 10 and 8% of the variability in serum GHBP activity.', 'title Human obesity is associated with increased serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) concentration. This study examines whether reduced body fat mass after vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) is associated with a decrease in serum HGF concentration. Serum HGF concentration and body weight, BMI, body fat mass, blood pressure, serum leptin, insulin, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol concentrations were studied in 10 obese women before and 1 year after VBG. 10 lean, healthy women were used as controls. Obese women showed significantly higher serum HGF concentration than control (lean, healthy) subjects. The mean serum HGF concentration decreased significantly 1 year after VBG, but did not reach the value observed in lean women. After VBG, BMI, body fat mass and serum HGF had similar patterns of decrease. Moreover, serum HGF concentration was positively correlated with both BMI (r=0.6, P<0.01) and body fat mass (r=0.6, P<0.01). Before surgery in obese women, elevated blood pressure was observed, which decreased after VBG. Linear regression analysis between blood pressure and serum HGF concentration using all subjects, showed no correlation between either systolic blood pressure and serum HGF concentration (r=.15, P=NS) or between diastolic blood pressure and serum HGF concentration (r=0.1, P=NS). Insulin resistance index (HOMA score), serum leptin, insulin and triacylglycerol concentrations decreased 1 year after VBG. However, serum cholesterol concentration did not change significantly.', 'title There is debate over the most appropriate adiposity markers of obesity-associated health risks.

We measured hs-CRP and major cardiovascular risk factors. Participants with abdominal adiposity had BMI similar to that in control subjects (24.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 24.7 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2), respectively), but significantly higher waist circumference (96.4 +/- 6.0 vs. 83.3 +/- 6.7 cm; P < 0.01) and WHR (1.07 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.05; P < 0.001).

Severe obesity is thus expected to have more important alterations of the metabolic profile than moderate obesity. This study aimed to compare the metabolic profile of pre- and postmenopausal severely obese women with moderately obese women. First, the metabolic profile of pre- (n=165) and postmenopausal (n=43) severely obese women (body mass index (BMI) > or =40 kg/m(2)) was compared to that of pre- (n=52) and postmenopausal (n=35) moderately obese women (BMI of 30-40 kg/m(2)). Thereafter, pre- and postmenopausal severely obese women were divided into two subgroups according to the presence/absence of a dysmetabolic profile. We used for comparison, a group of pre- and postmenopausal moderately obese women without a dysmetabolic profile. The metabolic profile of pre- and postmenopausal severely obese women was less deteriorated than expected when compared to moderately obese women. Moreover, severely obese women with or without a dysmetabolic profile displayed comparable or even lower plasma levels of cholesterol, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, and a lower cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio than moderately obese women (P< or =0.05). After menopause, the metabolic profile of severely obese women, dysmetabolic or not, was similar to that of moderately obese women.

It has been reported that beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphisms are associated with obesity. This study examines the associations of beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphism with relationships between plasma norepinephrine (NE) and leptin to evaluate further the mechanisms of obesity. In 329 normotensive (BP <140/90 mm Hg) men with a wide range of BMI (17.0 to 36.5 kg/m2), we measured BMI, total body fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio (W/H), BP, plasma NE, leptin, and the beta2-(Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu) adrenoceptor polymorphisms. The subjects consisted of 206 nonobese (BMI <25 kg/m2) and 123 overweight or obese (BMI >or=25 kg/m2) men. Overweight or obese subjects had a significantly higher frequency of Gly16 and Glu27 alleles compared with nonobese subjects. The subjects carrying Gly16 or Glu27 alleles regardless of BMI had greater total fat mass, W/H and plasma leptin compared with those without the Gly16 or Glu27 alleles, indicating that Gly16 and Glu27 alleles of the beta2-adrenoceptor gene are related to obesity and fat mass. Only in the nonobese subjects who carried the Gly16 and Glu27 alleles was there a high plasma NE level, but similar in overweight or obese subjects. To evaluate leptin-mediated sympathetic activation, we performed linear regression analyses between plasma leptin and NE. In groups with and without the Gly16 or Glu27 alleles, plasma leptin correlated with NE, but the slope in the group carrying the Gly16 or Glu27 allele was significantly lower than that without the Gly16 or Glu27.', 'title Obesity is associated with abnormalities of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis. The role of serum IGF-1 measurement for recognition of hypothalamic-pituitary diseases in obesity is still a matter of debate. This study evaluated the serum levels of IGF-1 in a population of severely obese women before and after long-term weight loss obtained by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Eighty obese women with body mass index (BMI) of more than 34\\xa0kg/m(2) and 80 unrelated age-matched lean controls were enrolled. IGF-1 serum levels were measured together with BMI, liver volume, and intra-abdominal fat thickness assessed by ultrasound. Evaluation was repeated 2\\xa0years after LAGB. Our results showed that mean IGF-1 levels in obese subjects before LAGB were significantly lower (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) than that observed in age-matched controls. Age and BMI were independent predictors of serum IGF-1 values, overall accounting for 39\\xa0% of IGF-1 variability. The mean IGF-1 concentration significantly increased 2\\xa0years after LAGB. BMI reduction was independently associated with IGF-1 increase (r\\u2009=\\u2009-0.29, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).

The anti-inflammatory interleukin-10, angiotensin type 2 receptor, Mas receptor and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 mRNA expressions in the NTS increased in the RT-HFD compared to SED-HFD.', 'title High-intensity exercise induces several health benefits, but may acutely and transiently increase the risk of cardiovascular events due to thrombotic changes promoting blood coagulation and thrombin formation. This study examined the effects of high-intensity exercise on plasma thrombin generation and triacylglycerol concentrations. Sixteen healthy men completed two, 2-day conditions separated by 1\\xa0week. On day 1, participants rested (control) or completed four, 3-min high-intensity rowing intervals at an average rating of perceived exertion of 17 (exercise). Venous blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention to determine plasma thrombin generation. On day 2, participants rested and consumed a glucose load (0\\xa0h) and high-fat meal (2\\xa0h). Fifteen venous blood samples were collected between 0 and 8\\xa0h to measure plasma thrombin generation and triacylglycerol concentrations.

No significant differences in lipid profiles were observed between the HFD and HFD+Ex groups. Although changes in body and brown adipose tissue weights were comparable between the HFD and HFD+Ex groups, white adipose tissue weight was significantly lower in the HFD+Ex group than in the HFD group.

In this cross-sectional study, 87 hypertensive patients (57.5 ± 9.9 years of age) had their physical activity assessed over a 7 day period using an accelerometer and the time spent in sedentary activities, light physical activities, moderate physical activities and moderate-to-vigorous physical activities was obtained. The primary outcomes were brachial and central blood pressure. Arterial stiffness parameters (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and cardiac autonomic modulation (sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in the heart) were also obtained as secondary outcomes. Sedentary activities and light physical activities were positively and inversely associated, respectively, with brachial systolic (r = 0.56; P < 0.01), central systolic (r = 0.51; P < 0.05), brachial diastolic (r = 0.45; P < 0.01) and central diastolic (r = 0.42; P < 0.05) blood pressures, after adjustment for sex, age, trunk fat, number of antihypertensive drugs, accelerometer wear time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activities.

Signaling from adipocytes is considered important in this context. Adiponectin is the most abundant adipocytokine and has been associated with various measures of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study examines the relationships between genetic variants in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and adiponectin-related signaling pathway genes and measures of subclinical CVD (vascular calcified plaque and carotid intima-media thickness), plasma lipids, and inflammation in T2DM. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ (n = 45), SNPs tagging ADIPOR1 (n = 6), APIPOR2 (n = 8), APPL1 (n = 6) and known rare coding variants in KNG1 (n = 3) and LYZL1 (n = 3) were genotyped in 1220 European Americans from the family-based Diabetes Heart Study. Associations between SNPs and phenotypes of interest were assessed using a variance components analysis with adjustment for age, sex, T2DM-affected status, and body mass index. There was minimal evidence of association between SNPs in the adiponectin signaling pathway genes and measures of calcified plaque; eight of the 71 SNPs showed evidence of association with subclinical CVD (P = 0.007-0.046) but not with other phenotypes examined. Nine additional SNPs were associated with at least one of the plasma lipid measures (P = 0.008-0.05).', 'title Overexpression of Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (Angptl2) in obese adipose tissues promotes adipose tissue inflammation and its-related metabolic abnormalities. In a comparative study with adiponectin, we investigated whether alterations in serum Angptl2 concentrations reflect the effect of lifestyle intervention on weight loss and improved metabolic parameters in overweight subjects. A total of 154 Japanese men (age, 40.9±5.1 years; body mass index, 26.9±3.6\\u2009kg\\u2009m(-2); abdominal circumference, 94.1±8.9\\u2009cm) underwent a 3-month lifestyle intervention and underwent follow-up for 3 months thereafter. Decreased serum Angptl2 levels, but not increased serum adiponectin levels, were immediately apparent at the end of 3-month lifestyle intervention. Angptl2 levels continued to decrease for 3 months in parallel with body weight loss and improvement in metabolic indicators. In subjects showing \\ue2f66% weight reduction, markedly reduced Angptl2 levels were detected at the end of 3-month intervention, whereas increased adiponectin levels were detected 3 months after the end of intervention. Multivariate analysis revealed changes in serum Angptl2 levels associated with changes in triglycerides (TGs), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. In contrast, changes in serum adiponectin levels were associated with altered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and fasting plasma glucose levels.', 'title To examine whether the inflammatory phenotype found in obese and diabetic individuals is preserved in isolated, cultured myocytes and to assess the effectiveness of pharmacological AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation upon the attenuation of inflammation in these myocytes. Muscle precursor cells were isolated from four age-matched subject groups: 1) nonobese, normal glucose tolerant; 2) obese, normal glucose tolerant; 3) obese, impaired glucose tolerant; and 4) obese, type 2 diabetes (T2D). The level of inflammation (nuclear factor-κB [NF-κB] signaling) and effect of pharmacological AMPK activation was assessed by Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and radioactive assays (n = 5 for each subject group). NF-κB-p65 DNA binding activity was significantly elevated in myocytes from obese T2D patients compared with nonobese control subjects. This correlated to a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor-α concentration in cell culture media. In addition, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was completely suppressed in myocytes from obese impaired glucose tolerant and T2D subjects. It is interesting that activation of AMPK by A769662 attenuated NF-κB-p65 DNA binding activity in obese T2D cells to levels measured in nonobese myocytes; however, this had no effect on insulin sensitivity of the cells.', 'title Adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) are considered as candidate genes for type 2 diabetes because they mediate the metabolic effects of adiponectin on target tissues. We investigated whether common polymorphisms of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 are associated with type 2 diabetes or its related phenotypes in Koreans. By sequencing of the DNA samples from 24 unrelated Korean subjects, we selected seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from ADIPOR1 and four SNPs from ADIPOR2 for genotyping in 757 type 2 diabetic patients and 644 nondiabetic subjects. None of the SNPs were associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, g.-7309A>G (rs75172865) in ADIPOR1 was associated with lower insulin resistance, measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Thereafter, we transfected three different human cell lines with plasmids harbouring g.-7309A>G and found that this variant reduced the promoter activity of ADIPOR1.

We tested whether a new macrophage-derived biomarker, soluble CD163 (sCD163), identifies at-risk individuals before overt disease has developed. A prospective cohort study of 8849 study participants from the general population, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, was followed for 18 years for incidence of type 2 diabetes. Risk of disease was calculated according to age- and sex-adjusted percentile categories of serum sCD163 concentrations: 0%-33%, 34%-66%, 67%-90%, 91%-95%, and 96%-100%. A total of 568 participants developed type 2 diabetes. The cumulative incidence increased with increasing baseline sCD163 (trend P < 0.001), and sCD163 was strongly associated with known risk factors such as physical inactivity, body mass index, C-reactive protein, and triglycerides (all P < 0.001). Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for type 2 diabetes were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0-1.9), 2.4 (1.8-3.2), 3.8 (2.6-5.5), and 5.2 (3.6-7.6) for categories 34%-66%, 67%-90%, 91%-95%, and 96%-100%, respectively, vs the 0%-33% category.

However, studies in humans are controversial and analyzes at the onset of disease are scarce. We compared adiponectin and leptin levels between 74 predominately Caucasian adolescents with T2DM and 74 body mass index (BMI)-, age-, and gender-matched controls without T2DM. Adiponectin and leptin were correlated to age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, and lipids. Adolescents with T2DM showed significant lower leptin levels as compared with controls (18 ± 12 vs. 37 ± 23 ng/mL, p < 0.001), whereas the adiponectin levels did not differ between the adolescents with and without T2DM (5.0 ± 2.5 vs. 4.9 ± 2.5 µg/mL, p = 0.833). The associations between adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (r = 0.42), systolic (r = -0.15), and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.20) were stronger as the associations of leptin to these parameters (all r < 0.07). In multiple linear regression analysis, leptin was significantly and positively associated with BMI [β-coefficient: 1.3 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): ±0.5), p < 0.001] and female sex [β-coefficient: 9.7 (95% CI: ±6.7), p = 0.005], and negatively with age [β-coefficient: -2.3 (95% CI: ±2.1), p < 0.001] and HbA1c [β-coefficient -3.1 (95% CI: ±2.1), p = 0.011].

However, little is known about the relationship between adiponectin and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). We investigated the association between adiponectin and IGT and between adiponectin and cardiovascular risk factors among subjects with IGT. Subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)(n = 571) and impaired glucose tolerance (n = 167) were recruited from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study in south India. Serum total adiponectin levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was estimated by nephelometry.

To derive a more precise estimation, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between five AdipoQ polymorphisms [-11426A > G (rs16861194), -11391G > A (rs17300539), -11377C > G (rs266729), +45T > G (rs2241766) and +276G > T (rs1501299)], and T2DM risk. The fixed and random-effects model should be used to assess the summary odds ratios (ORs) of each study. ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. On the basis of the included criteria, we selected 39 papers, among which eight for -11426A > G, 14 for -11391G > A, 21 for -11377C > G, 28 for +45 T > G and 24 for +276G > T. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the results. Both Begg's funnel plots and Egger's test are commonly used to evaluate publication bias. Overall, we found that individuals with the -11426G allele had a 0.15-fold significantly increased T2DM risk (additive model: 1.15, 1.04-1.27, 0.222). In the stratified analyses, we found that the -11426A > G, -11391G > A and -11377C > G polymorphisms could increase T2DM risk in European populations in the additive model. For Asian populations, we found that the -11377C > G polymorphism also could elevate T2DM risk.\", 'title Adipocytokine genes encoding adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and the leptin receptor (LEPR) affect glucose and fatty acid metabolism.

Blood samples from T2DM patients were taken for DNA extraction, and levels of serological markers were measured at enrollment. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping (three SNPs in AIDPOQ and four SNPs in LEPR) by polymerase chain reaction in each patient. Polymorphisms at the position rs10937273 in ADIPOQ and at the positions rs1892534 and rs2211651 in LEPR were statistically associated with early-onset T2DM (P=0.0246, 0.0014 and 0.0012, respectively).

Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) elements DNA methylation levels (%meth) in blood, a marker of global DNA methylation, have recently been associated with fasting glucose, blood lipids, heart diseases and stroke. To test whether LINE-1%meth levels in VAT are associated with MetS phenotypes and whether they can predict MetS risk in severely obese individuals. DNA was extracted from VAT of 34 men (MetS-: n\\u2009=\\u200914, MetS+: n\\u2009=\\u200920) and 152 premenopausal women (MetS-: n\\u2009=\\u200984; MetS+: n\\u2009=\\u200968) undergoing biliopancreatic diversion for the treatment of obesity.

In addition to brain-regulated processes, recent genome wide association studies have indicated that genes highly expressed in adipose tissue affect the distribution and function of fat and thus contribute to obesity. Using a stratified transcriptome gene enrichment approach we attempted to identify adipose tissue-specific obesity genes in the unique polygenic Fat (F) mouse strain generated by selective breeding over 60 generations for divergent adiposity from a comparator Lean (L) strain. To enrich for adipose tissue obesity genes a 'snap-shot' pooled-sample transcriptome comparison of key fat depots and non adipose tissues (muscle, liver, kidney) was performed. Known obesity quantitative trait loci (QTL) information for the model allowed us to further filter genes for increased likelihood of being causal or secondary for obesity. This successfully identified several genes previously linked to obesity (C1qr1, and Np3r) as positional QTL candidate genes elevated specifically in F line adipose tissue. A number of novel obesity candidate genes were also identified (Thbs1, Ppp1r3d, Tmepai, Trp53inp2, Ttc7b, Tuba1a, Fgf13, Fmr) that have inferred roles in fat cell function. Quantitative microarray analysis was then applied to the most phenotypically divergent adipose depot after exaggerating F and L strain differences with chronic high fat feeding which revealed a distinct gene expression profile of line, fat depot and diet-responsive inflammatory, angiogenic and metabolic pathways. Selected candidate genes Npr3 and Thbs1, as well as Gys2, a non-QTL gene that otherwise passed our enrichment criteria were characterised, revealing novel functional effects consistent with a contribution to obesity.\", 'title Obesity is associated with an impaired ability to switch from fatty acid to glucose oxidation during the fasted to fed transition, particularly in skeletal muscle. However, whether such metabolic inflexibility is reflected at the gene transcription level in circulatory mononuclear cells (MNC) is not known.

This study aimed to validate the relationship between serum osteocalcin and indices of obesity and lipid parameters in a group of Malaysian men. A total of 373 men from the Malaysian Aging Male Study were included in the analysis. Data on subjects' demography, body mass index (BMI), body fat (BF) mass, waist circumference (WC), serum osteocalcin and fasting lipid levels were collected. Bioelectrical impendence (BIA) method was used to estimate BF. Multiple linear and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the association between serum osteocalcin and the aforementioned variables, with adjustment for age, ethnicity and BMI. Multiple regression results indicated that weight, BMI, BF mass, BF %, WC were significantly and negatively associated with serum osteocalcin (p < 0.001). There was a significant positive association between serum osteocalcin and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p = 0.032). Binary logistic results indicated that subjects with low serum osteocalcin level were more likely to be associated with high BMI (obese and overweight), high BF%, high WC and low HDL cholesterol (p < 0.05). Subjects with high osteocalcin level also demonstrated high total cholesterol level (p < 0.05) but this association was probably driven by high HDL level. These variables were not associated with serum C-terminal of telopeptide crosslinks in the subjects (p > 0.05).\", 'title Epigenetic alterations may influence the metabolic pathways involved in human obesity. We hypothesised that global DNA methylation levels in adipose tissue might be associated with obesity and related phenotypes. We measured global DNA methylation levels in paired samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and omental visceral adipose tissue (OVAT) from 51 individuals, and in leucocytes from 559 Sorbs, a population from Germany, using LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA). To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed associations, we measured global methylation levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to glucose, insulin and lipids. Global methylation levels (±SD) were significantly higher in OVAT (74.27%\\u2009±\\u20092.2%) compared with SAT (71.97%\\u2009±\\u20092.4%; paired t test, p\\u2009<\\u20091\\u2009×\\u200910(-9)). Furthermore, global methylation levels in SAT were positive correlates of measures of fat distribution (waist measurement, WHR) and glucose homeostasis (HbA1c) (all p\\u2009<\\u20090.015 after accounting for multiple testing and covariates). Global methylation levels in the German Sorb cohort were associated with glucose homeostasis, but this association did not withstand adjustment for covariates. Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to insulin, palmitate and glucose decreased global methylation levels 1\\xa0h after treatment relative to controls.', 'title As nuclear receptors and transcription factors have an important regulatory function in adipocyte differentiation and fat storage, genetic variation in these key regulators and downstream pathways may be involved in the onset of obesity. To explore associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes from regulatory pathways that control fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and repeated measurements of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in a large Dutch study population. Data of 327 SNPs across 239 genes were analyzed for 3575 participants of the Doetinchem cohort, who were examined three times during 11 years, using the Illumina Golden Gate assay. Adjusted random coefficient models were used to analyze the relationship between SNPS and obesity phenotypes. False discovery rate q-values were calculated to account for multiple testing. Significance of the associations was defined as a q-value < or = 0.20. Two SNPs (in NR1H4 and SMARCA2 in women only) were significantly associated with both BMI and waist circumference. In addition, two SNPs (in SIRT1 and SCAP in women only) were associated with BMI alone. A functional SNP, in IL6, was strongly associated with waist.', 'title Low mitochondrial activity in adipose tissue is suggested to be an underlying factor in obesity and its metabolic complications.

Studies on animal models and cell cultures suggest aberrant glucose and lipid levels, and impaired insulin signaling might lead to mitochondrial changes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial aberrance remains largely unexplored in human subjects. Here we show that the mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAn) was significantly reduced (6.9-fold lower, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) in the leukocytes from obese humans (BMI >30). The reduction of mtDNAn was strongly associated with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: -0.703, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05; fasting insulin level: -0.015, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05); by contrast, the correlation between fasting glucose or lipid levels and mtDNAn was not significant.

What drives these changes is not well understood. We aimed to explore fat cell epigenetics, i.e., DNA methylation, as one mediator of gene regulation, in obese women.

Global array-based transcriptome analysis was analyzed for subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) from 11 obese and 9 never-obese women. Limma was used for statistical analysis. We identified 5529 differentially methylated DNA sites (DMS) for 2223 differentially expressed genes between obese cases and never-obese controls (false discovery rate <5\\xa0%). The 5529 DMS displayed a median difference in beta value of 0.09 (range 0.01 to 0.40) between groups. DMS were under-represented in CpG islands and in promoter regions, and over-represented in open sea-regions and gene bodies. The 2223 differentially expressed genes with DMS were over-represented in key fat cell pathways: 31 of 130 (25\\xa0%) genes linked to \"adipogenesis\" (adjusted P\\u2009=\\u20091.66\\u2009×\\u200910(-11)), 31 of 163 (19\\xa0%) genes linked to \"insulin signaling\" (adjusted P\\u2009=\\u20091.91\\u2009×\\u200910(-9)), and 18 of 67 (27\\xa0%) of genes linked to \"lipolysis\" (P\\u2009=\\u20096.1\\u2009×\\u200910(-5)). In most cases, gene expression and DMS displayed reciprocal changes in obese women.

We here aimed to dissect whether alterations in white adipocyte mitochondrial respiratory function are a specific phenomenon of obesity or impaired glucose tolerance or both. Mature white adipocytes were purified from posterior subcutaneous and intraabdominal epididymal fat of four murine obesity models characterized by either impaired or normal oral glucose tolerance. Bioenergetic profiles, including basal, leak, and maximal respiration, were generated using high-resolution respirometry. Cell respiratory control ratios were calculated to evaluate mitochondrial respiratory function. Maximal respiration capacity and cell respiratory control ratios were diminished in white adipocytes of each of the four murine obesity models, both in the absence and the presence of impaired glucose tolerance. Limitation was more pronounced in adipocytes of intraabdominal versus subcutaneous fat.']"

Weight and height were also recorded to obtain the body mass index. In agreement with the literature, the boys reported greater perceived physical self-efficacy than girls. Moreover, the number of boys who are obese is double that of girls, while the number of boys who are underweight is half that found in girls.

In a cross-sectional study of 72 healthy children (39 boys and 33 girls) ranging in age from 8 to 14 years, sex differences in anthropometric and motor performance characteristics were compared at 3 Tanner stages (T1-T3). Outcome variables included dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements of body composition, assessments of neuromuscular function, and levels of physical activity (steps/day) measured by accelerometry. Physical activity was lower in girls than boys at T2 and T3, but there was no sex difference at T1. Physical activity increased with Tanner stage for boys but did not differ between Tanner stages in girls.

Ethnically diverse (n = 1989) 5th, 7th, and 9th graders attending California schools comprised the sample. Aerobic fitness was determined by a 1-mile run/walk test; body mass index (BMI) was obtained from state-mandated measurements. California standardized test scores were obtained from the school district. Students whose mile run/walk times exceeded California Fitnessgram standards or whose BMI exceeded Centers for Disease Control sex- and age-specific body weight standards scored lower on California standardized math, reading, and language tests than students with desirable BMI status or fitness level, even after controlling for parent education among other covariates. Ethnic differences in standardized test scores were consistent with ethnic differences in obesity status and aerobic fitness.

In addition, the association between weight status and academic achievement was examined by comparing children who could be classified as \"extremely obese\" and the rest of the sample, as well as comparing children who could be classified as normal weight, overweight, or obese. Extreme obesity was defined as ≥1.2 times the 95th percentile. The results indicated that there were no significant associations between adiposity or physical activity and achievement in students. No academic achievement differences were found between children with BMI percentiles within the extreme obesity range and those who did not fall within the extreme obesity classification. In addition, no academic achievement differences were found for children with BMI percentiles within the normal weight, overweight, or obese ranges.']"

BMD of 30 men with active JIA and 23 healthy men was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. Clinical variables that influence bone mass were also analyzed. T scores were calculated based on Caucasian normative data. Absolute BMD (g/cm(2)) was significantly lower in men with active JIA compared to controls at all measured sites, i.e., lumbar spine (p = 0.018), hip (p = 0.018), and distal third of forearm (p = 0.044). More subjects in the JIA group had low BMD (T score <or= -1.0) than controls at hip (22/30 vs 9/23; p < 0.05) and distal third of forearm (27/30 vs 10/23; p < 0.001), while at lumbar spine region the difference was not statistically significant (22/30 vs 13/23). A significant negative correlation of BMD was found with joint deformities, limitation of joint movement, Health Assessment Questionnaire score, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. BMD at the hip and distal third of forearm was significantly lower in patients having arthritis at these sites.

This study was the first to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) in relatively young heroin-dependent patients on injectable heroin maintenance. Using cross-sectional design, BMD was assessed in a convenience sample of 19 patients (mean age ± SD = 33.9 ± 5.4; 13 men) prescribed injectable diacetylmorphine for heroin dependence. BMD of the lumbar spine and proximal femur was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Substance use and menstrual history, psychopathology and risk factors for low BMD were assessed by questionnaire-based interviews. According to World Health Organisation criteria almost three-quarters (74%) of the sample had osteopenia (n = 11) or osteoporosis (n = 3) at one or more sites of measurement. All patients showed multiple risk factors for bone loss, with pack-years of tobacco use and years of heroin use reaching marginally significant associations with spine Z-scores. Moreover, BMD Z-scores correlated significantly negatively with increasing age at all sites, indicating that the older the patient, the greater the BMD deviation from an age-controlled population.', 'title Not reaching an optimal peak bone mass during adolescence puts young patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) at risk for osteoporosis. Qualitative techniques were employed to determine whether having a bone mineral density (BMD) measurement affected the attitudes and behaviors of young women with AN. Nineteen adolescents with AN who had undergone BMD measurements were questioned about the experience of having the test and reactions to the results. Themes were identified and statistical analyses were performed. Participants perceived a normal or low BMD in healthy and unhealthy ways.

One of the proposed reasons for this is a more sedentary lifestyle. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between muscle strength and total body bone mineral density (TBMD) in young adults at expected peak bone mass. Sixty-four women and 61 men (total 125) 21 years of age were included. Handgrip strength, isokinetic knee-flexion and -extension muscle strength, TBMD, and body composition were measured. Univariate regression analyses showed that knee flexion and extension explained almost 30% of the variation in TBMD in women, whereas handgrip strength was not associated with TBMD. In men, no correlation between any measures of muscle strength and TBMD was evident. Stepwise regression analysis showed that knee-flexion and -extension muscle strength in women were associated with TBMD, R2=0.27. In men, lean body mass, fat mass, weight, and height were predictors for TBMD, R2=0.43, whereas muscle strength did not affect the prediction of TBMD.', 'title Loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and resultant fractures increase with age in both sexes.

Cross-sectional methods. The athletes completed a detailed health history questionnaire and underwent calcaneal quantitative ultrasound to measure BMD. Athletes were classified as participating in high impact sports (basketball, road race [running], track and field, triathalon, and volleyball) or non-high-impact sports. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine the influence of high-impact sports on BMD. On average, participants were 65.9 years old (range, 50 to 93).

Depressive conditions have been related to the reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) in adulthood. Though it is possible to hypothesize that depressive symptoms present similar effects in bone mineral accrual during adolescence, such association is poorly researched. Therefore, we aimed to study the relation between depressive symptoms and forearm BMD during adolescence.

Sequential sample of 35 asymptomatic relatives, aged 19 to 59 years, of patients with osteoporotic fractures, and 24 patients with osteoporotic fractures. Bone mineral density in the spine was measured by quantitative computed tomographic scanning. Bone mineral content in the os calcis was measured in 19 of the relatives of osteoporotic patients by single-photon absorptiometry. The values for bone mineral density in the spine were corrected to age 50 years with the regression equation derived from the normal values in the controls. The values were lower in relatives of osteoporotic patients than in controls.

BMS was measured in 90 patients (mean age, 61.0 y; range, 40.4-85.5 y) with low bone mass with or without a fragility fracture. Sixty-three patients had sustained one or more fragility fractures. There was a significant negative correlation between age and BMS (r = -0.539; P < .001) and with the 10-year fracture probability with and without inclusion of femoral neck BMD as calculated by FRAX (r = -0.383; P < .001 and r = -0.426; P < .001, respectively). BMS values were lower in patients with a fragility fracture compared with nonfracture patients (79.9 ± 0.6 vs 82.4 ± 1.0; P = .032) despite similar BMD. BMS was comparable in patients with a fragility fracture whether they had osteopenia or osteoporosis (79.8 ± 0.8 vs 78.7 ± 1.1; P = .456).

And initial bone mineral density (BMD) was proposed to serve as a new prognostic factor of curve progression in AIS. However, it remains unknown whether there is a link between the initial bone mineral status and the outcome of brace treatment. This study aimed to investigate whether the initial bone mineral status could influence the final outcome of brace treatment in AIS. Girls with AIS treated with brace treatment were recruited. These patients either completed brace treatment, or were indicated for correction surgery with a curve magnitude of >45 degrees. Patients with a progressed scoliosis (group A) and those with a nonprogressed scoliosis (group B) were identified. The associations between the bracing outcome and the indices before bracing, including growth status, anthropometric measurements, BMD status, curve magnitude, and curve pattern were evaluated using univariate analysis and regression analysis. Sixty-eight patients were included. There were 17 girls (25%) in group A and 51 girls (75%) in group B, respectively. The girls in group A had a significantly larger initial Cobb angle (32.3±6.6 vs. 29.1±5.3 degrees), a significantly lower BMD of lumbar spine from L2 to L4 value (0.80±0.11 vs. 0.88±0.12 g/cm), and a marginally significantly lower Risser grade (1.4±1.5 vs. 2.2±1.4), than in group B. In comparison with group B, more girls in group A were found to be premenarche (P=0.008), osteopenic (P=0.003), with a lower Risser grade (P=0.079), a greater curve magnitude (P=0.159), and a main thoracic pattern (P=0.122) before the initiation of bracing treatment. As revealed by the multiple logistic regression analysis, osteopenia (P=0.002) was identified as an independent risk factor in curve progression in AIS girls, during the total duration of bracing treatment.']"

Negative visceral states have been theorized to increase demand for alcohol and to contribute to excessive drinking patterns, but little empirical research has evaluated this possibility. The present study tested the hypothesis that symptoms of depression and PTSD would be uniquely associated with elevated alcohol demand even after taking into account differences in typical drinking levels. An Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) was used to generate a demand curve measure of alcohol reinforcement in a sample of 133 college students (50.4% male, 64.4% Caucasian, 29.5% African-American) who reported at least one heavy drinking episode (5/4 or more drinks in one occasion for a man/woman) in the past month. Participants also completed standard measures of alcohol consumption and symptoms of depression and PTSD. Regression analyses indicated that symptoms of depression were associated with higher demand intensity (alcohol consumption when price=0; ΔR(2)=.05, p=.002) and lower elasticity (ΔR(2)=.04, p=.03), and that PTSD symptoms were associated with all five demand curve metrics (ΔR(2)=.04-.07, ps<.05).', 'title Although research has documented robust prospective relationships between externalizing symptomatology and subsequent adolescent alcohol use, the extent to which internalizing symptoms such as anxiety may increase risk for alcohol consumption remains controversial. Recent evidence suggests that one possible reason for mixed findings is that separate dimensions of anxiety differentially confer risk for alcohol use. The present study tested two dimensions of anxiety, worry and physiological anxiety symptoms, as predictors of alcohol use and misuse in a longitudinal sample of juvenile offenders. Participants were 818 male juvenile offenders drawn from a larger multi-site, longitudinal study. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models estimated the influence of anxiety symptoms on typical drinking quantity, frequency of binge drinking, and alcohol dependence symptoms. Results indicate that physiological anxiety and worry symptoms showed differential relations with alcohol use risk. Physiological anxiety was positively associated with increased risk for typical alcohol involvement, frequency of binge drinking, and alcohol dependence symptoms, whereas worry was negatively associated with all alcohol use outcomes.', 'title Intense alcohol consumption is a risk factor for a number of health problems. Dual-process models assume that self-regulatory behavior such as drinking alcohol is guided by both reflective and impulsive processes. Evidence suggests that (a) impulsive processes such as implicit attitudes are more strongly associated with behavior when executive functioning abilities are low, and (b) higher neural baseline activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with better inhibitory control. The present study integrates these 2 strands of research to investigate how individual differences in neural baseline activation in the lateral PFC moderate the association between implicit alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior. Baseline cortical activation was measured with resting electroencephalography (EEG) in 89 moderate drinkers. In a subsequent behavioral testing session they completed measures of implicit alcohol attitudes and self-reported drinking behavior. Implicit alcohol attitudes were related to self-reported alcohol consumption. Most centrally, implicit alcohol attitudes were more strongly associated with drinking behavior in individuals with low as compared with high baseline activation in the right lateral PFC.', 'title To investigate the effects of stress on alcohol craving and attentional bias for alcohol-related cues in a group of heavy social drinkers. Forty-four heavy social drinkers were exposed to either a laboratory stressor task or a control manipulation before completing a questionnaire measure of alcohol craving and a visual probe task which measured attentional bias for alcohol-related cues. Participants were subdivided into those with high and low levels of coping motives for drinking. Compared to a control manipulation, the laboratory stressor task produced increases in alcohol craving (P < 0.01). The laboratory stressor task also produced a significant attentional bias for alcohol-related cues, but only among participants who had high levels of coping motives (P < 0.05).', \"title Evidence suggests that alcohol-related problems are associated with impulsivity and disinhibited behavior. Less certain is whether disinhibited behavior is due to an impulsive disposition or alcohol's ability to disinhibit some people more than others. There are a range of disinhibited behaviors associated with alcohol, including excessive alcohol consumption, bingeing. The study tested whether nondependent alcohol bingers showed more disinhibition after placebo and/or alcohol relative to nonbingers and whether this was related to enhanced motivation to drink following a priming dose of alcohol. Twenty participants (10 bingers) attended the laboratory twice. Baseline measures included impulsivity, alcohol-related cognitions, alcohol urge, and mood. Participants were preloaded with alcohol (male: 0.6 g/kg, female: 0.5 g/kg) and placebo (counterbalanced). After a 20-minute rest, participants completed 2 impulsivity tasks (Two Choice & Time Estimation) separated by second urge and mood ratings. Bingers did not show greater impulsivity characteristics but were more concerned about their drinking (p = 0.02) and ability to control drinking (p = 0.04). A priming effect was found: alcohol urge increased after alcohol but not placebo (p = 0.006). Bingers reported greater tolerance to the sedative (p = 0.05) and lightheaded (p = 0.04) effects of alcohol, relative to nonbingers.

The sample was composed by 31 alcohol-dependent individuals and 34 healthy controls without alcohol use disorders. Electrocardiogram was recorded at rest and during execution of a validated moral judgment task, including non-moral scenarios, and moral dilemmas that were either high in emotional salience (\"personal scenarios\") or low in emotional salience (\"impersonal scenarios\"). Alcohol-dependent individuals showed a blunted response to moral dilemmas. Furthermore, healthy controls displayed decreased heart rate to the personal vs. impersonal or non-moral scenarios, while alcohol-dependent individuals failed to differentiate dilemmas in terms of heart rate both prior decision-making and its post appraisal. These deficits were not related to baseline differences in Heart Rate.', 'title This study used a four-factor model of impulsivity to investigate inter-relationships between alcohol consumption, impulsivity, motives for drinking and the tendency to engage in alcohol-related problem behaviours. 400 University students aged 18-25 completed an online survey consisting of the following measures: Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance and Sensation Seeking Scale (UPPS) to measure impulsivity; Student Alcohol Questionnaire to assess drinking quantity, frequency and rates of problem behaviours; Drinking Motives Questionnaire to assess motives for drinking. The majority of the sample (94.5%) drank alcohol at least monthly. Path analysis revealed direct effects of urgency, sensation seeking and premeditation, as well as the quantity of alcohol consumed, on the tendency to engage in risky behaviours with negative consequences. The effect of urgency was mediated by drinking for coping motives and by a combined effect of drinking for social motives and consumption of wine or spirits. Conversely the effect of sensation seeking was mediated by the quantity of alcohol consumed, irrespective of drink type, and the effect of premeditation was mediated by the consumption of wine and spirits, in combination with enhancement motives.', \"title Whether alcohol increases or decreases individual differences relative to sober levels may depend on the situation in which behavior is measured. This study tested the hypothesis that reinforcement and behavioral standards will modify the effects of alcohol on individual differences. Two groups of male social drinkers (N = 12) performed a psychomotor task under repeated doses of alcohol (0.62 g/kg), and received verbal feedback (FB) for matching an easy or a difficult performance standard. FB reduced between-subject and within-subject differences under alcohol, especially when coupled with the easy standard. Between-subject and within-subject differences were equivalent under alcohol and sober conditions when variance introduced by changing blood drug concentrations was controlled. The consistency of an individual's performance across doses depended on the consistency of his criterion response.\", 'title Stress evokes thoughts about alcohol and enhances alcohol\\'s rewarding value in drinkers who use alcohol to cope with negative affect. The present study extends prior research by examining whether this effect applies to actual alcohol consumption following a stressor and whether individuals with high and low coping motives for drinking differ in stress reactivity. Nondependent drinkers with high scores (﹥1 SD above national norms) on the coping motives subscale on the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (n = 41; 46% women) were enrolled along with age- and gender-matched nondependent drinkers with low coping motives (n = 41).

Following the stress manipulation, participants could consume up to 473 ml of beer in a \"taste test,\" a covert measure of alcohol consumption. Stress reactivity was measured with both objective and subjective indices, and milliliters of beer consumed was the alcohol-relevant outcome. Participants with high coping motives showed a less robust stress response to the Trier Social Stress Test than participants with low coping motives for drinking. However, the stressor did not result in greater consumption of alcohol (i.e., no main effect of stress induction) or differential drinking in the two motive groups (i.e., no Stressor × Coping Motive group interaction).']"

The authors used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data to determine whether comorbidity burden and comorbidity-related care are associated with stage at diagnosis, whether these associations are mediated by mammography use, and whether they explain racial/ethnic disparities. Stage at diagnosis and mammography use were analyzed in multivariate regression models, adjusting for comorbidity burden and comorbidity-race interactions among 118,742 women diagnosed with breast cancer during 1993 to 2005. Mammography utilization was higher among women with ≥ 3 stable comorbidities than among those without comorbidities. Advanced stage at diagnosis was associated with black race (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-1.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5), unstable comorbidity, and age ≥ 80 years.

The black/white OR fell to 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.5) among women with multiple stable comorbidities who received ≥ 2 screening mammograms, and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.8-1.3) among mammography users with unstable comorbidities.', 'title HIV infection disproportionately impacts minorities; yet research on racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence and correlates of HIV risk behaviors is limited. This study examined racial/ethnic differences in the rates of HIV risk behaviors and whether the relationship between HIV risk factors and HIV risk behaviors varies by race/ethnicity in clients participating in NIDA Clinical Trials Network trials. The sample was 41% non-Hispanic White, 32% non-Hispanic Black, and 27% Hispanic (N = 2,063). HIV risk behaviors and measures of substance and psychosocial HIV risk factors in the past month were obtained. Non-Hispanic Blacks engaged in less HIV sexual risk behaviors overall than non-Hispanic Whites. While non-Hispanic Whites were the most likely to report any injection drug use, Hispanics engaged in the most HIV drug risk behaviors. Specific risk factors were differentially predictive of HIV risk behavior by race/ethnicity. Alcohol use severity was related to engaging in higher sex risk behaviors for non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites. Greater psychiatric severity was related to engaging in higher sex risk behaviors for non-Hispanic Whites. Drug use severity was associated with engaging in higher risk drug behaviors for non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics with the magnitude of the relationship stronger for Hispanics.', 'title Rehospitalization rates are higher in African American than Caucasian patients with heart failure (HF). The reasons for the disparity in outcomes between African Americans and Caucasians may relate to differences in medication adherence. To determine whether medication adherence is a mediator of the relationship between ethnicity and event-free survival in patients with HF. Medication adherence was monitored longitudinally in 135 HF patients using the Medication Event Monitoring System. Events (emergency department visits for HF exacerbation, HF and cardiac rehospitalization, and all-cause mortality) were obtained by interview and hospital data base review. A series of regression models and survival analyses was conducted to determine whether medication adherence mediated the relationship between ethnicity and event-free survival. Event-free survival was significantly worse in African Americans than Caucasians. Ethnicity was a predictor of medication adherence (P=.011). African Americans were 2.57 times more likely to experience an event than Caucasians (P=.026).

Therefore, these data may inaccurately attribute differences in obesity to race rather than differing social context. The goal of this study was to investigate whether race disparities in obesity among women persist in a community of black people and white people living in the same social context with similar income. Race disparities in obesity were examined among black women and white women living in the same social context with similar income, using the data from the Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated Communities-SWB (EHDIC-SWB) study, and these estimates were compared to national data (National Health Interview Survey) to determine if race disparities in obesity were attenuated among women in EHDIC-SWB. Obesity was based on participants' self-reported height and weight. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between race and obesity. In the national sample, black women exhibited greater odds of being obese (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.32) than white women after controlling for covariates.

However, in a setting of equal health care access, these disparities were not evident. Currently, disparities exist with use of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) in the treatment of appendicitis. This study determines whether equal health care access eliminates differences in the management and outcomes of appendicitis. A retrospective review from 1998 to 2007 was performed. All members in this single-provider system have equal healthcare access. Socioeconomic data were extracted from the US Census database. Study outcome was use of LA and postoperative morbidity. Independent variables included age (18-44 y, 45-65 y, and >65 y), gender, race, annual mean household income (<40 K, 40-65 K, and >65 K), and education level. Univariate and multivariable (controlling for age, gender, perforation, race/ethnicity, income, and education level) analyses were performed. A total of 16,196 patients were identified (mean age = 41 y, 54% male). Sixty percent of patients underwent LA. On multivariable analysis, male gender was associated with a decreased use of LA (OR 0.84, CI 0.79-0.89, P < 0.0001). There was a lower use of LA in older patients (age > 65 y) and patients age 45-65 y compared with younger patients (18-44 y). There was a lower use of LA in Blacks and a higher rate in Hispanics compared with Whites. Use of LA was higher in high income and middle income patients compared with low income patients. The use of LA was similar across all education levels. Postoperative morbidity was higher in males, older patients (age > 65 y), and patients age 45-65 y.

We examined differences in illness severity, charges, and length of stay between white and black hospitalized elderly. The study sample was 1184 elderly patients. Data using the Computerized Severity Index were collected for admission, maximum throughout the stay, and discharge. Blacks were admitted significantly more severely ill than whites. At discharge, 96% were severity level 1. At each severity level, blacks had significantly shorter hospitalizations and lower charges. The differences were not explained by disease, surgery, age, sex, hospital, and payer.', 'title The objective is to apply the Institute of Medicine definition of healthcare disparities in order to compare (1) racial/ethnic disparities in general medical care use among older adults with and without comorbid mental health need and (2) racial/ethnic disparities in general medical care use within the group with comorbid mental health need. Data were obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (years 2004-2012). The sample included 21,263 participants aged 65+\\u2009years (14,973 non-Latino Caucasians, 3530 African-Americans, and 2760 Latinos). Physical illness was determined by having one of the 11 priority chronic health illnesses. Comorbid mental health need was defined as having one of the chronic illnesses plus a Kessler-6 Scale >12, or two-item Patient Health Questionnaire >2. General medical care use refers to receipt of non-mental health specialty care. Two-part generalized linear models were used to estimate and compare general medical care use and expenditures among older adults with and without a comorbid mental health need. Racial/ethnic disparities in general medical care expenditures were greater among those with comorbid mental health need compared with those without. Among those with comorbid mental health need, non-Latino Caucasians had significantly greater expenditures on prescription drug use than African-Americans and Latinos.', \"title To examine (1) racial/ethnic disparities in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and overall health status among African-American, Hispanic, and white 5th graders in the general population and (2) the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) and other family contextual variables mediate any disparities. A total of 4824 African-American, Hispanic, and white fifth-graders participating in a population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in 3 U.S. metropolitan areas reported their own HRQOL by using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 and supplemental personal and social well-being scales. Parents reported these children's overall health status. SES was indexed by parent education and household income. Other family contextual variables included family structure and degree to which English is spoken at home. Marked racial/ethnic disparities were observed across all measures of HRQOL and health status, favoring white children and especially disfavoring Hispanic children. Most of these disparities were no longer significant after adjusting for SES and other family contextual differences that were observed among these racial/ethnic groups.

We performed an observational study using patient-level data for acute myocardial infarction (5 care measures), congestive heart failure (2 measures), community-acquired pneumonia (2 measures), and patient counseling (4 measures). Data were obtained from 123 hospitals reporting to the University HealthSystem Consortium from the third quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2005. A total of 320,970 patients 18 years or older were eligible for at least 1 of the 13 measures.

All patients underwent cardiac MRI for the assessment of left ventricular function, morphology, infarct size and aortic PWV 12 months after acute STEMI. Blood samples were drawn at 12 months by peripheral venipuncture. Levels of hs-TnT were measured by a commercially available immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics). hs-TnT levels (6.4\\u200ang/l, inter-quartile range 5.0-8.6) were significantly associated with age (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.417, P\\u200a<\\u200a0.001), plasma creatinine levels (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.257, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.027), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.281, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.015) and aortic PWV (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.435, P\\u200a<\\u200a0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed aortic PWV (ß\\u200a=\\u200a0.330, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.025), apart from plasma creatinine concentrations (ß\\u200a=\\u200a0.279, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.010), to be independently associated with hs-TnT concentrations (model: R\\u200a=\\u200a0.597, P\\u200a<\\u200a0.001).', 'title Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity is a well-known predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Few studies have evaluated the relationship between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) and coronary artery disease. We conducted this study to elucidate the relationship between arterial stiffness measured by ba-PWV and coronary atherosclerosis. An automatic waveform analyzer was used to measure the ba-PWV. Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography was used to assess the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and to detect coronary stenosis. A total of 654 patients, including 358 women and 296 men (mean age, 54.5 ± 9.4 years), were recruited during the period March 2005 to June 2008. One hundred and twenty-seven patients (19.4%) had at least one stenotic coronary vessel. Mean ba-PWV and mean CAC scores were significantly higher in the stenotic group than in the normal control (15.94 ± 3.07 m/s vs. 14.39 ± 0.98 m/s; 293.1 ± 435.9 vs. 29.8 ± 110.8, respectively; both p < 0.001). The adjusted OR for coronary stenosis increased as ba-PWV increased (p for trend = 0.0001). Using ba-PWV < 14.0 m/s as the reference group, we found that ba-PWV between 14.0-18.0 m/s and ba-PWV > 18.0 m/s were significantly associated with coronary stenosis (OR, 2.48; CI, 1.56-3.93 and OR, 3.16; CI, 1.68-5.95, respectively). The cutoff point at 15.64 m/s using the ROC curve showed a sensitivity of 64.5%, specificity of 65.6%, and an AUC of 0.662 in predicting coronary artery stenosis. Ba-PWV had an additional power for correlating coronary artery disease with the Framingham risk score.']"

This may be because the restricted service availability at weekends leads to selection of patients with greater average severity of illness. We examined volumes and rates of hospital admissions and deaths across the week for patients presenting to emergency services through two routes: (a) hospital Accident and Emergency departments, which are open throughout the week; and (b) services in the community, for which availability is more restricted at weekends. Retrospective observational study of all 140 non-specialist acute hospital Trusts in England analyzing 12,670,788 Accident and Emergency attendances and 4,656,586 emergency admissions (940,859 direct admissions from primary care and 3,715,727 admissions through Accident and Emergency) between April 2013 and February 2014.Emergency attendances and admissions to hospital and deaths in any hospital within 30 days of attendance or admission were compared for weekdays and weekends. Similar numbers of patients attended Accident and Emergency on weekends and weekdays. There were similar numbers of deaths amongst patients attending Accident and Emergency on weekend days compared with weekdays (378.0 vs. 388.3). Attending Accident and Emergency at the weekend was not associated with a significantly higher probability of death (risk-adjusted OR: 1.010).Proportionately fewer patients who attended Accident and Emergency at weekend were admitted to hospital (27.5% vs. 30.0%) and it is only amongst the subset of patients attending Accident and Emergency who were selected for admission to hospital that the probability of dying was significantly higher at the weekend (risk-adjusted OR: 1.054).The average volume of direct admissions from services in the community was 61% lower on weekend days compared to weekdays (1317 vs. 3404). There were fewer deaths following direct admission on weekend days than weekdays (35.9 vs. 80.8). The mortality rate was significantly higher at weekends amongst direct admissions (risk-adjusted OR: 1.212) due to the proportionately greater reduction in admissions relative to deaths.', 'title Psychiatric patients experience longer treatment times (length of stay [LOS]) in the emergency department (ED) compared to nonpsychiatric patients. Although patients on involuntary mental health holds are relatively understudied, common wisdom would hold that times for these patients can only be affected by addressing systems issues because they are not free to leave. The objective of this study was to determine whether both selected ED and patient-specific factors were associated with longer LOS. We hypothesized that nonmodifiable factors (age, sex, agitation, presentation during evenings/nights, presentation during weekends, suicidal ideation) would prolong LOS but that potentially modifiable factors (such as use of medication) would reduce LOS. A historical cohort of patients (January 1, 2009-August 16, 2010) placed on involuntary mental health holds was studied in 2 general EDs. A regression model was used to calculate the effects of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors on LOS. Six hundred forty patient visits met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Longer LOSs were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, use of antipsychotics, and use of benzodiazepines, although agitation did not predict longer LOSs. Longer LOSs were also longer with presentation on the weekends.', \"title Physicians may avoid code status discussions for fear of decreasing patient or surrogate satisfaction. Charts of patients admitted to medical services at 6 university hospitals were reviewed for documentation of a code status discussion in the first 24 hours of admission.

Of the 11 717 patients with 1-month follow-up, 1090 (9.3%) had a code status discussion documented. Patient or surrogate satisfaction did not differ by whether a discussion was documented. The lack of association persisted after adjusting for patient's severity of illness and using propensity adjustment for likelihood of having a discussion.\", 'title Mentally ill patients in crisis presenting to critical access hospital emergency rooms often face exorbitant wait times to be evaluated by a trained mental health provider. Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of an emergency telemental health evaluation service implemented in a rural hospital emergency room. Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presenting to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time. There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a mental health evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a mental health specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation =6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures.', 'title Analysts and clinicians sitting in operating room (OR) committee meetings cannot evaluate rapidly whether a suggested idea to reduce delays in first case of the day starts can be beneficial economically. Three years of data were used from a six OR outpatient surgery facility. The cost reduction from reducing the tardiness of start of first cases of the day was calculated using the method of McIntosh et al. (Anesth Analg 2006;103:1499-516), limited to ORs with at least 8 h of cases and turnovers. Results were then reported per minute reduction in tardy first case of the day starts as an approximation for rapid use in meetings. Each 1.0 min reduction in the tardy starts of first cases of the day in ORs with more than 8 h of cases and turnovers resulted overall in 1.1 +/- 0.1 min reduction in regularly scheduled labor costs (mean +/- se). This result was close to the 1.2 min obtained using an entirely different (simulation) method performed previously for OR time reductions. Secondary analyses confirmed that assumptions were satisfied at the facility, thereby reducing the chance that results are biased. For example, the proportions of the variance in tardiness attributable to anesthesiologists and specialties were only 1% and 3%, respectively, and there were no significant differences in tardiness among the 85 anesthesiologists or 14 specialties.', 'title To ascertain the impact of the introduction of a unitary patient record (UPR) on clerking documentation of emergency medical admissions. Retrospective casenote audit. Random sample of 100 unselected admissions to the medical assessment unit of a major teaching hospital, comprising two groups pre- and post-introduction of the UPR. Statistically significant improvements in the documentation of several items were achieved; function before episode, ethnic origin, chest pain, breathlessness, ankle oedema, cough, bowel habit and locomotor symptoms and recording of blood pressure and peripheral pulses. There were trends towards improvement in other areas and there were no areas in which the UPR performed less well than standard documentation.', 'title To assess whether variables such as unit occupancy and aggregate severity of illness that reflect increased work demands on physicians in medical intensive care units (MICU) are associated with increased delays in their obtaining information about nonroutine chest radiographic examinations. To determine whether the presence of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstation in the MICU shortens those delays. A prospective cohort study stratified for presence or absence of PACS. MICU of a university hospital. A total of 118 patients admitted to the MICU who had nonroutine bedside chest radiographs. Multivariate analyses were conducted to determine how unit occupancy, patient acuity, the time of day the examination was taken, and the presence of a PACS workstation influenced the time from radiographic examination completion to the time when MICU physicians first obtained image information. In a multivariate analysis, patient acuity, unit occupancy, the aggregate level of severity of illness in the study cohort, whether the examination was taken at night or day, and the presence of a PACS workstation were significant predictors of the elapsed time from examination completion until review by MICU physicians. Without the PACS workstation, higher occupancy, higher aggregate severity of illness, and examinations taken during the day were associated with longer delays. Overall, the multivariate analysis showed a 24-min decrease in the elapsed time to obtain information during periods with the PACS workstation compared with periods without the workstation (p = .03).', \"title The effect on efficiency of patient care in a busy academic interventional radiology practice was studied by the analysis of procedure times both before and after the implementation of a computerized interactive daily schedule.

The delay in the start of the first case, the time between cases, and the time required to complete each day's work were compared for the two periods. The average time of delay between cases was reduced after the implementation of the software (p < 0.025). More total cases were performed during the period of time after the implementation of the software, resulting in a greater work relative value unit production. Although the average number of cases performed per day was greater after the software was in use (p < 0.03), the average amount of time required to complete the day's work was not significantly changed (p = 0.08). There was no apparent effect on the average delay of the start of the day's first case (p = 0.34).\", \"title In today's short stay hospital settings the contact time for patients is reduced. However, it seems to be more important for the patients that the healthcare professionals are easy to get in contact with during the whole course of treatment, and to have the opportunity to exchange information, as a basis for obtaining individualized information and support. Therefore, the aim was to explore the ability of a dialogue-based application to contribute to accessibility of the healthcare professionals and exchangeability of information. An application for online written and asynchronous contacts was developed, implemented in clinical practice, and evaluated. The qualitative effect of the online contact was explored using a Web-based survey comprised of open-ended questions. Patients valued the online contacts and experienced feelings of partnership in dialogue, in a flexible and calm environment, which supported their ability to be active partners and feelings of freedom and security.\"]"

Actual glucose metabolic values in AD may be reduced artificially because of brain atrophy, which accentuates the partial volume effect (PVE) on data collected by PET. Using segmented MR images, we corrected regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose for PVEs to evaluate the effect of atrophy on uncorrected values for brain metabolism in AD patients and healthy control subjects. Global glucose metabolism was reduced significantly before and after correction in AD patients compared with controls. Before PVE correction, glucose metabolic values in patients were lower than in control subjects in the inferior parietal, frontal, and lateral temporal cortex; in the posterior cingulate; and in the precuneus. These reductions remained significantly lower after PVE correction, although in the posterior cingulate the difference in metabolism between AD patients and control subjects lessened. Regional glucose metabolism of these areas with PVE correction was lower in moderately-severely demented patients than in mildly demented patients.\", \"title The objective of this study was to develop a process to maximize the safety and effectiveness of disclosing Positron Emission Tomography (PET) amyloid imaging results to cognitively normal older adults participating in Alzheimer's disease secondary prevention studies such as the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study. Using a modified Delphi Method to develop consensus on best practices, we gathered and analyzed data over three rounds from experts in two relevant fields: informed consent for genetic testing or human amyloid imaging. Experts reached consensus on (1) text for a brochure that describes amyloid imaging to a person who is considering whether to undergo such imaging in the context of a clinical trial, and (2) a process for amyloid PET result disclosure within such trials. Recommendations included: During consent, potential participants should complete an educational session, where they receive verbal and written information covering what is known and unknown about amyloid imaging, including possible results and their meaning, implications of results for risk of future cognitive decline, and information about Alzheimer's and risk factors. Participants should be screened for anxiety and depression to determine suitability to receive amyloid imaging information. The person conducting the sessions should check comprehension and be skilled in communication and recognizing distress. Imaging should occur on a separate day from consent, and disclosure on a separate day from imaging. Disclosure should occur in person, with time for questions. At disclosure, investigators should assess mood and willingness to receive results, and provide a written results report.

This study investigated whether partial-volume effect correction (PVEC), adjusting for this atrophy bias, improves the accuracy of (18)F-florbetaben Aβ PET. We analyzed (18)F-florbetaben PET and MRI data obtained from 3 cohorts. The first was 10 patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and 10 age-matched healthy controls (HCs), the second was 31 subjects who underwent in vivo imaging and postmortem histopathology for Aβ plaques, and the third was 5 subjects who underwent PET and MRI at baseline and 1 y later. The imaging data were coregistered and segmented. PVEC was performed using the voxel-based modified Müller-Gärtner method (PVELab, SPM8). From the PET data, regional and composite SUV ratios (SUVRs) with and without PVEC were obtained. In the MRI data, mesial temporal lobe atrophy was determined by the Scheltens mesial temporal atrophy scale and gray matter volumes by voxel-based morphometry. In cohort 1, PVEC increased the effect on AD-versus-HC discrimination from a Cohen d value of 1.68 to 2.0 for composite SUVRs and from 0.04 to 1.04 for mesial temporal cortex SUVRs. The PVEC-related increase in mesial temporal cortex SUVR correlated with the Scheltens score (r = 0.84, P < 0.001), and that of composite SUVR correlated with the composite gray matter volume (r = -0.75, P < 0.001). In cohort 2, PVEC increased the correlation coefficient between mesial temporal cortex SUVR and histopathology score for Aβ plaque load from 0.28 (P = 0.09) to 0.37 (P = 0.03). In cohort 3, PVEC did not affect the composite SUVR dynamics over time for the Aβ-negative subject.

Twelve subjects with Alzheimer disease dementia were included for comparison. Of the 123 CN participants who were amyloid-negative at baseline, 26 met criteria for incident amyloid PET positivity. Compared to the 69 subjects who remained stable amyloid-negative, on average these 26 did not differ on any imaging, demographic, or cognitive variables except amyloid PET (by definition) and task-free functional connectivity, which at baseline was greater in the incident amyloid-positive group.

This indicates that neuronal dysfunction might spread within the anatomical pattern of amyloid deposition. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal regional patterns of amyloid deposition and hypometabolism in the same population of mild AD subjects and to establish their regional relationship to each other. Twenty patients with mild AD underwent baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination with [(18)F] FDG-PET and [(11)C] PiB-PET. Voxel-by-voxel statistical group comparison (SPM5) was performed between patient BL- and FU-PET data as well as between patients and 15 PiB-negative elderly control subjects, who had undergone identical imaging procedures. To obtain objective measures of regional overlap, Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) between the imaging findings were calculated. Compared with elderly control subjects, AD patients showed typical patterns of BL hypometabolism and BL amyloid deposition, with a similarity of 40% (DSC). Amyloid deposition was more extended than hypometabolism at BL and showed only minor changes over time, whereas significant expansion of hypometabolism was observed, almost exclusively within areas already affected by BL amyloid deposition. Thus, increased similarity of FU hypometabolism with BL amyloid deposition was found (DSC: 47%).\", 'title To test the hypotheses predicted in a hypothetical model of Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers that rates of β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation on PET imaging are not related to hippocampal neurodegeneration whereas rates of neurodegenerative brain atrophy depend on the presence of both amyloid and neurodegeneration in a population-based sample. A total of 252 cognitively normal (CN) participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging had 2 or more serial visits with both amyloid PET and MRI. Subjects were classified into 4 groups based on baseline positive/negative amyloid PET (A+ or A-) and baseline hippocampal volume (N+ or N-). We compared rates of amyloid accumulation and rates of brain atrophy among the 4 groups.

Global, regional, and voxel-based correlations between PIB and hippocampal volume were computed for each group. In healthy control participants with elevated neocortex PIB retention, significant correlation was found between PIB retention in the inferior temporal region and hippocampal volume using both region-based and voxel-based approaches. No correlation was found in any other group.']"

Cohort studies in the United States, on the other hand, have consistently reported no difference in incidence across sex. To measure age- and sex-specific incidence rates of dementia and AD for persons aged 50 years and older residing in Rochester, Minn, during 1985 to 1989. Cases were ascertained through the medical records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which encompasses the records of all medical care providers (including outpatient clinics, hospitals, general practitioners, and nursing homes) in Rochester. Computer indices of clinical diagnoses, histologic diagnoses, and medical procedures were screened for indications of dementia. All medical records of potential cases were reviewed and abstracted by a trained nurse abstractor. A neurologist (E.K.) confirmed the presence of dementia and established a differential diagnosis of AD using the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and estimated the year of onset. A total of 482 incident cases of dementia were identified; 356 of them (73.9%) had AD. For both dementia and AD, incidence rates increased steeply with age, and there were no consistent differences between men and women. The sex pattern for AD did not change after removing cases with silent bilateral infarcts on imaging.', 'title Recent studies have suggested that AD may reflect a chronic process that begins many years before the clinical expression of dementia. The current study examines premorbid Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-vocabulary (WAIS-voc) test scores in order to determine whether long-term deficits in these tests can predict the development of AD decades later in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Participants are volunteers from the BLSA, a multidisciplinary study of normal aging conducted by the National Institute on Aging. A total of 1,425 BLSA participants who were older than 60 years were included in the analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative risk of developing AD associated with BVRT and WAIS-voc scores at different time periods up to 20 years before the diagnosis of AD. The relative risks for 6 or more BVRT errors vs less than 6 errors at 1 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 15 years before the diagnosis of AD were 5.69, 2.11, 1.76, and 1.83 (p < 0.05). The relative risk for 15 or more years before diagnosis was not significant (p > 0.10). WAIS-voc scores were not significantly associated with the risk of AD in any time period.', 'title This study investigated the effect of treadmill running on cognitive declines in the early and advanced stages of Alzheimer disease (AD) in 3xTg-AD mice. At 4 months of age, 3xTg-AD mice (N = 24) were assigned to control (AD + CON, n = 12) or exercise (AD + EX, n = 12) group. At 24 months of age, 3xTg-AD mice (N = 16) were assigned to AD + CON (n = 8) or AD + EX (n = 8) group. The AD + EX mice were subjected to treadmill running for 12 wk. At each pathological stage, the background strain mice were included as wild-type control (WT + CON, n = 8-12). At the early stage of AD, 3xTg-AD mice had impaired short- and long-term memory based on Morris water maze along with higher cortical Aβ deposition, higher hippocampal and cortical tau pathology, and lower hippocampal and cortical PSD-95 and synaptophysin. A 12-wk treadmill running reversed the impaired cognitive declines and significantly improved the tau pathology along with suppression of the decreased PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the hippocampus and cortex. At the advanced stage of AD, 3xTg-AD mice had impaired short- and long-term memory along with higher levels of Aβ deposition, soluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, tau pathology, and lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, PSD-95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus and cortex. A 12-wk treadmill running reversed the impaired cognitive declines and significantly improved the Aβ and tau pathology along with suppression of the decreased synaptic proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus and cortex.', \"title The temporal relationship of cognitive deficit and functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well characterized. Recent analyses suggest cognitive decline predicts subsequent functional decline throughout AD progression. To better understand the relationship between cognitive and functional decline in mild AD using autoregressive cross-lagged (ARCL) panel analyses in several clinical trials. Data included placebo patients with mild AD pooled from two multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 solanezumab (EXPEDITION/2) or semagacestat (IDENTITY/2) studies, and from AD patients participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed using AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living instrumental subscale (ADCS-iADL), or Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), respectively. ARCL panel analyses evaluated relationships between cognitive and functional impairment over time. In EXPEDITION, ARCL panel analyses demonstrated cognitive scores significantly predicted future functional impairment at 5 of 6 time points, while functional scores predicted subsequent cognitive scores in only 1 of 6 time points. Data from IDENTITY and ADNI programs yielded consistent results whereby cognition predicted subsequent function, but not vice-versa.\", \"title We examined whether impairment in specific cognitive domains in Alzheimer's disease (AD) differed according to APOE genotype and age at onset. Cognitive functions of 229 consecutive AD patients were assessed using Visual Association Test (VAT), Memory Impairment Screen+ (MIS+), VAT object naming, fluency test and Trail Making Test (TMT). Dementia severity was assessed using MMSE. ANOVAs were performed with APOE genotype and age at onset as independent variables and sex, education and MMSE as covariates. 28% of patients were APOE epsilon4-negative, 58% heterozygous and 14% homozygous. A significant association between APOE genotype and VAT and MIS+ was found when correcting for sex and education. An interaction effect between APOE genotype and age at onset on VAT and VAT object naming was found, with young carriers performing worse than young noncarriers.

In addition, subjective memory complaints (SMC) might be a first clinical expression of the effect of AD pathology on cognitive functioning. To assess whether APOEɛ4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory are risk factors for high amyloid-β (Aβ) burden in cognitively normal elderly. 307 cognitively normal participants (72.7 ± 6.8 years, 53% female, 55% SMC) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent amyloid PET and APOE genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of APOEɛ4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory with Aβ pathology. Odds of high Aβ burden were greater at an older age (OR\\u200a=\\u200a3.21; 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a1.68-6.14), when SMC were present (OR\\u200a=\\u200a1.90; 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a1.03-3.48), and for APOEɛ4 carriers (OR\\u200a=\\u200a7.49; 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a3.96-14.15), while episodic memory was not associated with odds of high Aβ burden.

Here we hypothesized that the \"disease signature\" of AD-related cortical thinning, previously identified in patients with mild AD dementia, would be useful as a biomarker to detect anatomic abnormalities consistent with AD in cognitively normal (CN) adults who develop AD dementia after longitudinal follow-up. We studied 2 independent samples of adults who were CN when scanned. In sample 1, 8 individuals developing AD dementia (CN-AD converters) after an average of 11.1 years were compared to 25 individuals who remained CN (CN-stable). In sample 2, 7 CN-AD converters (average follow-up 7.1 years) were compared to 25 CN-stable individuals. AD-signature cortical thinning in CN-AD converters in both samples was remarkably similar, about 0.2 mm (p < 0.05). Despite this small absolute difference, Cohen d effect sizes for these differences were very large (> 1). Of the 11 CN individuals with baseline low AD-signature thickness (≥ 1 SD below cohort mean), 55% developed AD dementia over nearly the next decade, while none of the 9 high AD-signature thickness individuals (≥ 1 SD above mean) developed dementia. This marker predicted time to diagnosis of dementia (hazard ratio = 3.4, p < 0.0005); 1 SD of thinning increased dementia risk by 3.4.', 'title Neural networks supporting encoding of new information are affected early in the course of Alzheimer disease (AD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in AD have reported decreased medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation when comparing novel versus repeated stimuli. It is, however, unclear whether this finding is related to a failure of normal suppression of MTL activity to repeated stimuli in AD. Twenty-nine healthy older subjects comprising a comparison group (OC) and 15 mild AD patients underwent fMRI during an associative memory paradigm in an academic medical center. The task consisted of blocks of Novel and Repeated face-name pairs and visual Fixation. To reveal neural correlates of processing repeatedly presented stimuli, Repeated blocks were contrasted to Fixation. AD patients demonstrated greater activation during Repeated stimuli in the MTL and in prefrontal and superior parietal cortices, compared with OC. In contrast, OC showed greater parietal task-induced deactivation than AD. Increased MTL activity during Repeated was correlated with more impaired parietal deactivation and poorer performance of the postscan recognition memory test of encoding the face-name pairs.', 'title To determine whether, and to what degree, preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) confounds studies of healthy aging where \"healthy\" is based on cognitive normality alone. We examined the effects of preclinical AD in cognitively normal older individuals using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. We investigated 2 groups of cognitively normal participants: one group with evidence of preclinical AD as assessed by CSF markers of AD and the other group with normal CSF biomarkers. There were significant interactions between age and biomarker status in the default-mode, dorsal attention, and salience resting-state networks. In the group with evidence of preclinical AD, there were dramatic changes in functional connectivity with age. In the group without evidence of preclinical AD, those changes were greatly attenuated. In most regions with significant interactions of age and biomarker status, the age-related change in functional connectivity in the normal biomarker group was indistinguishable from zero.', 'title To determine whether APOE epsilon 4 predicts rate of cognitive change in incident and prevalent Alzheimer disease (AD). Individuals were recruited from two longitudinal cohort studies-the Washington Heights and Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; population-based) and the Predictors Study (clinic-based)--and were followed for an average of 4 years. Three samples of participants diagnosed with AD, with diverse demographic characteristics and baseline cognitive functioning, were studied: 1) 199 (48%) of the incident WHICAP cases; 2) 215 (54%) of the prevalent WHICAP cases; and 3) 156 (71%) of the individuals diagnosed with AD in the Predictors Study. Generalized estimating equations were used to test whether rate of cognitive change, measured using a composite cognitive score in WHICAP and the Mini-Mental State Examination in Predictors, varied as a function of epsilon 4 status in each sample. The presence of at least one epsilon 4 allele was associated with faster cognitive decline in the incident population-based AD group (p = 0.01). Parallel results were produced for the two prevalent dementia samples only when adjusting for disease severity or excluding the most impaired participants from the analyses.']"

Longitudinal clinicopathologic cohort study. Forty-four individuals with clinically diagnosed AD and 53 without dementia who participated in the Religious Orders Study underwent a uniform structured clinical evaluation for AD and cognitive testing about 8 months prior to death, and brain autopsy at death. The percent area occupied by amyloid-beta and the density of neurofibrillary tangles were quantified from 6 brain regions and averaged to yield summary measures of amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles. Multivariate regression analyses were used to simultaneously examine the effects of amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles on clinically diagnosed AD and level of cognition. Clinically diagnosed AD and level of global cognitive function proximate to death. In separate logistic regression analyses, each 1% increase in amyloid load was associated with about a 50% increase in the odds of clinical AD (P =.002), and each neurofibrillary tangle was associated with a greater than 20% increase in the odds of clinical AD (P<.001). When a term for tangles was added to the regression model with amyloid, the association of amyloid load with clinical disease was reduced by more than 60% and was no longer significant, whereas the association of tangles with clinical disease was essentially unchanged. Similar results were found in analyses of global cognitive function.', \"title Previous studies have observed decreased serum CRP levels in patients with established Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to controls or other diagnostic groups of elderly patients with mental illness.

Data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) on socio-demographic and smoking-related characteristics of respondents were used. GATS is a nationally representative household survey. GATS provided data on a representative sample of 7,840 adult individuals--2,207 male and 1,321 female ever smokers. Logistic regression analysis was performed and the χ2 test for relevant calculations. Among males, the regular smoking initiation rate was significantly higher compared to females (59.2% vs. 34.2%; p<0.01). Mean age of smoking initiation was lower in men compared to women (18.4±3.6 vs. 20.0± 4.7 p < 0.01). Lack of awareness on smoking health consequences was strongly associated with initiating of regular smoking among both genders (unaware vs. aware respondents: OR = 3.0 CI 2.3-4.0; p < 0.001 in men and OR = 3.07 CI 2.3-3.9; p<0.001 in women). Older age, vocational education and unemployment were associated with regular smoking initiation among men and women. Also, not being religious considerably contributed to increased likelihood of smoking initiation in women (OR = 4.4 CI 2.5-7.7; p<0.001).', 'title Second hand tobacco smoke (SHS) and overweight/obesity are risk factors for asthma and lower airway respiratory symptoms. We investigated whether SHS or overweight/obesity were also associated with allergic or non-allergic rhinitis. Cross-sectional data were obtained during the second SAPALDIA Study. Interviewer administered questionnaires were completed by 8047 participants from 8 communities in Switzerland. Blood was collected from 5841 participants and tested for allergen specific IgE. Allergic rhinitis was defined as nasal symptoms with detectable IgE. Data were analysed by multinomial logistic regression with four outcome categories defined according to the presence or absence of rhinitis and/or atopy. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 885 (15.2%) and non-allergic rhinitis 323 (5.5%). The risk of allergic rhinitis was increased in subjects with physician diagnosed asthma (Relative Risk Ratio 6.81; 95%CI 5.39, 8.6), maternal atopy (1.56; 1.27, 1.92) and paternal atopy (1.41; 1.11, 1.79). Older subjects were at lower risk (0.96; 0.95,0.97 per year), as were those raised on a farm (0.64; 0.49,0.84), with older siblings (0.92; 0.86,0.97 per sib) or from rural areas. The risk of non-allergic rhinitis was also increased in subjects with physician diagnosed asthma (4.02; 2.86, 5.67), reduced in males (0.59; 0.46, 0.77), but not associated with upbringing on a farm or older siblings. There were no significant associations of SHS or overweight/obesity with either form of rhinitis.', 'title This study was undertaken in order to test the hypothesis that the consequences of tobacco smoking may include increased synthesis of toxic volatile sulphur compounds in diseased periodontal pockets. A cross-sectional, parallel study comparing groups of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis and the level of volatile sulphur compounds in the gingival sulci of these subjects. Levels of volatile sulphur compounds were measured in diseased periodontal sites of 12 smokers and 11 non-smokers using a portable sulphide monitor. Anaerobic and aerobic counts of the total cultivable subgingival microflora of both groups were also determined. The percentage of sites per subject with high levels of sulphides (> or = 10 units) detected in moderate (4-6 mm) and deep (> or = 7 mm) periodontal pockets was found to be significantly higher in smokers, compared to non-smokers (P = 0.040 and P = 0.005, respectively). No significant difference in the microbiological parameters tested were observed between the two groups.', \"title The association between tobacco smoke exposure and critical illness is not well studied, largely because obtaining an accurate smoking history from critically ill patients is difficult. Biomarkers can provide quantitative data on active and secondhand cigarette smoke exposure. We sought to compare cigarette smoke exposure as measured by biomarkers to exposure by self-report in a cohort of critically ill patients and to determine how well biomarkers of cigarette smoke exposure correlate with each other in this population. Serum and urine cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, and hair and nail nicotine levels were measured in 60 subjects enrolled in an observational cohort of critically ill subjects at a tertiary academic medical center in Tennessee. Smoking history was obtained from patients, their surrogates, or the medical chart. Cigarette smoke exposure as measured by biomarkers was compared to exposure by history. By smoking history, 29 subjects were identified as smokers, 28 were identified as nonsmokers, and 3 were identified as unknown. The combination of serum cotinine and urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol identified 27 of the 28 nonsmokers by history either as active smokers (n = 6, 21%) or as exposed to secondhand smoke (n = 21, 75%). All biomarker levels were strongly correlated with each other (r = .69-.95, p < .0001).\", 'title Both smoking and exposure to passive smoking have repeatedly been associated with increased multiple sclerosis (MS) risk, but have never before been studied together. We assessed the public health impact of these factors. In a Swedish population-based case-control study (2455 cases, 5336 controls), we calculated odds ratios of developing MS associated with different categories of tobacco smoke exposure, together with 95% confidence intervals, by using logistic regression. The excess proportion of cases attributable to smoking and passive smoking was calculated as a percentage. Both smoking and exposure to passive smoking contribute to MS risk in a dose-dependent manner. At the population level, 20.4% of all cases were attributable to smoke exposure. Among subjects carrying the genetic risk factor HLA-DRB1*15 but lacking HLA-A*02, 41% of the MS cases were attributable to smoking.', 'title Smoking is associated with a systemic inflammatory response. However, the role of genetic predisposition is not well known. We assessed whether circulatory acute phase reactants were associated with smoking and whether or not the association was modified by the major cytokine gene of the acute phase reaction, interleukin-6 (IL-6). In total, 1,003 postmyocardial infarction patients were recruited in six European cities and six repeated clinical examinations performed. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and fibrinogen levels were assayed at 5,659 subject visits. Genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in the IL-6 gene. Cumulative smoking (pack-years) and time since smoking cessation were strongly associated with blood levels of all three inflammatory markers. Among subjects without any respiratory disorder, these associations remained statistically significant for CRP and IL-6. A polymorphism in the IL-6 gene (rs2069840) showed an interaction with smoking on CRP (p < .001) and IL-6 (p = .049) peripheral levels.', 'title Tobacco smoking, a risk factor for diabetes, is an established modifier of DNA methylation. We hypothesised that tobacco smoking modifies DNA methylation of genes previously identified for diabetes. We annotated CpG sites available on the Illumina Human Methylation 450K array to diabetes genes previously identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and investigated them for an association with smoking by comparing current to never smokers. The discovery study consisted of 630 individuals (Bonferroni-corrected p\\u2009=\\u20091.4\\u2009×\\u200910(-5)), and we sought replication in an independent sample of 674 individuals. The replicated sites were tested for association with nearby genetic variants and gene expression and fasting glucose and insulin levels. We annotated 3,620 CpG sites to the genes identified in the GWAS on type 2 diabetes. Comparing current smokers to never smokers, we found 12 differentially methylated CpG sites, of which five replicated: cg23161492 within ANPEP (p\\u2009=\\u20091.3\\u2009×\\u200910(-12)); cg26963277 (p\\u2009=\\u20091.2\\u2009×\\u200910(-9)), cg01744331 (p\\u2009=\\u20098.0\\u2009×\\u200910(-6)) and cg16556677 (p\\u2009=\\u20091.2\\u2009×\\u200910(-5)) within KCNQ1 and cg03450842 (p\\u2009=\\u20093.1\\u2009×\\u200910(-8)) within ZMIZ1. The effect of smoking on DNA methylation at the replicated CpG sites attenuated after smoking cessation. Increased DNA methylation at cg23161492 was associated with decreased gene expression levels of ANPEP (p\\u2009=\\u20098.9\\u2009×\\u200910(-5)). rs231356-T, which was associated with hypomethylation of cg26963277 (KCNQ1), was associated with a higher odds of diabetes (OR 1.06, p\\u2009=\\u20091.3\\u2009×\\u200910(-5)). Additionally, hypomethylation of cg26963277 was associated with lower fasting insulin levels (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04).', \"title Smoking is an established risk factor for chronic pancreatitis (CP). We sought to identify how often and in which CP patients physicians consider smoking to be a risk factor. We analyzed data on CP patients and controls prospectively enrolled from 19 US centers in the North American Pancreatitis Study-2. We noted each subject's self-reported smoking status and quantified the amount and duration of smoking. We noted whether the enrolling physician (gastroenterologist with specific interest in pancreatology) classified alcohol as the etiology for CP and selected smoking as a risk factor. Among 382/535 (71.4%) CP patients who were self-reported ever smokers, physicians cited smoking as a risk factor in only 173/382 (45.3%). Physicians cited smoking as a risk factor more often among current smokers, when classifying alcohol as CP etiology, and with higher amount and duration of smoking. We observed a wide variability in physician decision to cite smoking as a risk factor. Multivariable regression analysis however confirmed that the association of CP with smoking was independent of physician decision to cite smoking as a risk factor.\", 'title To analyse the association of smoking with paraoxonase (PON1) in Type 2 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetic patients were recruited independently in two centres (Ancona, Italy and Geneva, Switzerland) and serum PON1 mass and activities were assayed. Current smoking status was established and its association with serum PON1 analysed. Type 2 diabetic patients who smoked had significantly lower serum PON1 mass and activity. This was evident in both groups of patients, even though Swiss patients were composed of coronary patients. Multivariate analyses established that smoking was an independent determinant of serum PON1 status.', 'title Smoking contributes to progression of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Because smoking is also a risk factor for incident rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis, our aim was to test whether smoking habits are associated with incident AS. Using data from the HUNT health study of the entire adult population of Nord-Trøndelag, Norway, participants in HUNT2 (1995-1997) and HUNT3 (2006-2008) were identified who reported a diagnosis of AS in HUNT3 but not in HUNT2 (n = 107). Incident AS cases were compared with AS-unaffected individuals (n = 35,278) in a case-control design. Participants with RA were excluded. Present smoking was significantly associated with incident self-reported AS in logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.11, p = 0.002). Previous smoking (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.66-2.02, p = 0.62) or total pack-years at HUNT2 (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.04, p = 0.21) were not significant. The association with present smoking remained significant in various sensitivity analyses: including only cases with high probability of true AS diagnosis (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.03-3.19, p = 0.04); including only cases with AS reported more than 3-5 years after HUNT2 (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-5.03, p = 0.029), or including only participants genotyped for HLA-B27 (94 cases and 859 controls) adjusting for genotype (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.04-2.85, p = 0.033). Hypertension was also significantly associated with incident AS (OR from 1.65 to 2.81).']"

The relationship between p53 expression and survival after curative operations for gastric carcinoma was evaluated. Paraffin-embedded specimens from 135 patients who underwent curative resection of gastric carcinoma were analyzed immunohistochemically for p53 expression. Immunoreactivity of p53 was found in 37 of 135 gastric tumors. Six of 48 early gastric carcinomas expressed focally scattered p53. Pattern of p53 expression in the majority of advanced carcinomas was diffuse. In univariate analyses a significant relationship with survival was found for tumor size (p < 0.01), depth of invasion (p < 0.01), nodal involvement (p < 0.01), and p53 expression (p < 0.01). Significant relationships were found between p53 expression and nodal involvement (p < 0.01) and depth of invasion (p < 0.01). A multivariate analysis revealed that the independent predictors of recurrence were nodal involvement (p = 0.009) and depth of invasion (p = 0.009). In a logistic multiple regression analysis p53 expression was not independently related to the parameters, which suggests an aggressive tumor.', \"title To investigate the mechanism of PAI-1 overexpression in gastric cancers, the PAI-1 expression levels in gastric cancers were compared to those in the corresponding normal tissues. A quantitative RT-PCR for PAI-1 gene was performed in gastric cancers and corresponding normal tissues, and evaluated the association between the PAI-1 expression levels in gastric cancers and those in corresponding normal tissues. There was a significant correlation between gastric cancer and corresponding normal PAI-1 expressions with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.74 (p < 0.0001). PAI-1 expression levels in corresponding normal tissues increased significantly with tumor stage [stage I, -8.04 +/- 0.72; stage II, -7.71 +/- 0.61: stage III, -6.81 +/- 0.51; stage IV, -4.95 +/- 0.20 (p = 0.0022)).\", 'title This study examined the correlation between P53 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression together with tumour vascularity and investigated their clinical significance in the prognosis of gastric carcinoma.

No significant correlation was found between p53 expression and clinicopathologic factors. The rate of VEGF positivity was significantly higher in patients with haematogenous metastasis than in those without haematogenous metastasis. Both p53 and VEGF expression were associated with MVC. The MVC in p53 positive tumours was significantly higher than that in p53 negative tumours. Similarly, the same trend was seen between VEGF expression and MVC.

All tissue samples were derived from gastric cancer patients underwent curative gastrectomy as a primary treatment. Clinical and pathological information were obtained from the medical records. Gene expression microarray data from 60 cancer and 19 non-cancer gastric tissues were analyzed to evaluate the expression level of PKM2 mRNA. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 368 gastric cancer patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure PKM2 expression and PKM2 positivity of cancer was determined by proportion of PKM2-positive tumor cells and staining intensity. Association between PKM2 expression and the clinicopathological factors was evaluated and the correlation between PKM2 and cancer prognosis was evaluated. PKM2 mRNA levels were increased more than 2-fold in primary gastric cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues from the same patients (log transformed expression level: 7.6 ± 0.65 vs 6.3 ± 0.51, P < 0.001). Moreover, differentiated type cancers had significantly higher PKM2 mRNA compared to undifferentiated type cancers (log transformed expression level: 7.8 ± 0.70 vs 6.7 ± 0.71, P < 0.001). PKM2 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of primary cancer cells and detected in 144 of 368 (39.1%) human gastric cancer cases. PKM2 expression was not related with stage (P = 0.811), but strongly correlated with gastric cancer differentiation (P < 0.001). Differentiated type cancers expressed more PKM2 protein than did the undifferentiated ones. Well differentiated adenocarcinoma showed 63.6% PKM2-positive cells; in contrast, signet-ring cell cancers showed only 17.7% PKM2-positive cells. Importantly, PKM2 expression was correlated with shorter overall survival (P < 0.05) independent of stage only in signet-ring cell cancers.', 'title The authors examined whether expression of p21 (waf1/cip1/sdi1) and p53 protein was related to survival, rates in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. The expression of p21 and p53 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 93 patients with advanced gastric carcinoma with serosal invasion and lymph node metastasis. All patients underwent curative surgery. The probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the generalized Wilcoxon test. Various levels of p21 and p53 immunoreactivities in carcinoma cells were detected in 30 (32%) and 60 (65%), respectively, of 93 samples. There was no correlation between p21 and p53 expression. The 5-year survival rate of patients with p21 expression was 69.4%, which was significantly better than that of patients without p21 expression (38.1%; P < 0.05). However, p53 protein expression did not correlate with patient survival.', 'title p53 plays an important role in the development of gastric carcinomas through its effect on apoptosis. Its use as a biomarker of tumorigenesis and progression in clinical tissue is currently under consideration. This project assessed its value in early and advanced stage gastric carcinomas. The characteristics of positive staining for p53 was evaluated in 202 gastric adenocarcinomas classified into early stage (T1) (127 cases) and advanced stage (T2, 3 and 4) (75 cases) using the tumor-node-metastasis classification. Four subgroups (classified as p53 negative, +, ++ and +++ according to the level of positivity) were investigated for relationships with apoptosis (morphology) or cell proliferation (Ki-67). The mucosa of early stage and both mucosa and subserosa of advanced cancers were examined. p53-positive early stage cancers had more apoptosis but also more proliferation than p53-negatives (P<0.05), perhaps indicating conferral of a growth advantage. In advanced cancers, there was no correlation between apoptosis and extent of p53 positivity. p53 positivity had no correlation with cell proliferation in the mucosa and subserosa of these cancers.', 'title Tumor angiogenesis is associated with disease stage in gastric carcinoma. The tumor suppressor p53 was recently reported to regulate angiogenesis. We investigated the relationship between nuclear p53 accumulation and tumor vascularity in gastric carcinoma. Patients with gastric carcinoma undergoing surgery were randomly enrolled. Nuclear p53 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry on tumor sections was categorized as higher and lower groups. Tumor vascularity was assessed by counting microvessel density on anti-CD34 stained sections. Tumor vascularity between different p53 expressions was compared based on the different clinicopathologic characteristics. Twenty-three patients had gastric carcinoma with higher nuclear p53 expression and 42 with lower nuclear p53 expression. Vascularity in higher p53 group (54.3 +/- 35.3) was significantly higher than that in lower p53 group (32.1 +/- 29.9) (p = 0.009). Further analysis showed that higher nuclear p53 immunoreactivity was associated with significantly higher vascularity in the advanced gastric carcinoma group (p = 0.023), the intestinal type group (p = 0.003), the non-cardiac group (p = 0.019), and the H. pylori-negative group (p = 0.014).', 'title The growth pattern of advanced gastric carcinoma, based on volumetric analysis, is closely associated with the biological characteristics of tumors, including DNA ploidy, and is an important prognostic factor. Abnormality of the p53 tumor suppressor gene plays an important role in alteration of cells and possibly leads to cancer development. Expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 was investigated immunohistochemically in the primary lesion of 196 patients with advanced gastric cancers, and the relationship of p53 immunopositivity with the growth pattern and prognosis was analyzed. Positive p53 staining was found in 94 (48%) of the 196 primary carcinomas. Vessel invasions were more frequent and lymph node metastasis was more extensive in p53-positive tumors (p < 0.05), whereas p53 immunopositivity was not associated with depth of cancer invasion nor with the stage of cancer. In the column and mountain type tumors, characterized by vertical or penetrative growth, positive p53 staining was found in 53.8% and 52.9%, respectively. In the funnel type tumor, characterized by superficially spreading growth, positive p53 staining was found in significantly lower incidence (28.9%, p < 0.05). The 5-year survival rates were 44.2% and 25.4% for patients with p53 negative and positive gastric carcinomas, respectively (p < 0.01).

This study was designed to illustrate the value of PIK3CA amplification in combination with promoter methylation of RASSF1A and PAX6 genes in early diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer. Using real-time quantitative PCR, quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP), and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays, we examined PIK3CA amplification and promoter methylation of RASSF1A and PAX6 genes in a cohort of gastric cancers, and explored the association of various (epi)genotypes with clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients. We demonstrated that PIK3CA gene was specifically amplified in gastric cancers, but not in normal gastric tissues. Moreover, frequent methylation of RASSF1A and PAX6 was also found in gastric cancers. Given the patients harboring diverse (epi)genotypes, we thus investigated the effect of various (epi)genotypes on poor prognosis in gastric cancer. The data showed that concomitant PIK3CA amplification and RASSF1A or PAX6 methylation were closely associated with poor clinical outcomes, particularly survival, as compared to other (epi)genotypes in gastric cancer.', 'title It has been suggested that p53 plays an important part in gastric carcinogenesis but the data remain inconclusive. Alteration of the tumour suppressor gene p53 was prospectively investigated by immunohistochemistry in 168 primary gastric cancers. Positive staining, indicative of gene mutations, was detected in 34 tumours (20.2 per cent). No correlation was observed between expression of p53 and various clinicopathological factors, including age, sex, tumour site, gross type, tumour size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases, distant metastases, and tumour node metastasis stage. However, p53 overexpression was different between intestinal and diffuse type gastric cancer. Survival analysis revealed a significant survival disadvantage of p53 expression in diffuse type gastric cancer (P=0.039) but not in the intestinal type. Multivariate analysis of all 168 patients revealed that independent predictors of recurrent disease included age, invasion depth and nodal involvement but not p53 expression.']"

         "['title Mast cells are crucial effector cells in the allergic cascade. The cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) activates mast cells and basophils. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is positioned upstream of the IgE receptor signal transducing pathway and may represent an important target for the treatment of nasal inflammatory diseases. We measured effects of a specific Syk inhibitor in the release of mast cell mediators in human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBDMCs) (in-vitro) and in human nasal tissue (ex-vivo). Surgical samples were collected from patients with nasal polyposis who underwent sinus surgery. Tissue cubes of +- 0.9 mm3 were primed with myeloma IgE (1 microg/ml), preincubated with Syk inhibitor NVP-QAB205 in different concentrations and then stimulated with tissue culture medium, anti-IgE 10 microg/ml and anti-IgE 30 microg/ml. Supernatants were analysed for concentrations of histamine, LTC4/LTD4/LTE4 and PGD2. CBDMCs were likewise pre-incubated with compound, prior to stimulation with anti-IgE at 10 microg/ml. In CBDMCs, the Syk inhibitor prevented degranulation assessed by measurement of histamine release and the production of LTC4/LTD4/LTE4 and PGD2. Furthermore, the Syk inhibitor was similarly able to significantly inhibit the release of these granules and newly synthesized mediators by nasal polyp mast cells in a dose dependent manner.', 'title IgE-allergen complexes induce mast cell and basophil activation and thus immediate allergic inflammation. They are also important for IgE-facilitated allergen presentation to T\\xa0cells by antigen-presenting cells. To investigate whether the proximity of IgE binding sites on an allergen affects immune complex shape and subsequent effector cell activation in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. We constructed artificial allergens by grafting IgE epitopes in different numbers and proximity onto a scaffold protein. The shape of immune complexes formed between artificial allergens and the corresponding IgE was studied by negative-stain electron microscopy. Allergenic activity was determined using basophil activation assays. Mice were primed with IgE, followed by injection of artificial allergens to evaluate their in vivo allergenic activity. Severity of systemic anaphylaxis was measured by changes in body temperature. We could demonstrate simultaneous binding of 4 IgE antibodies in close vicinity to each other. The proximity of IgE binding sites on allergens influenced the shape of the resulting immune complexes and the magnitude of effector cell activation and in\\xa0vivo inflammation.', 'title Activation of mast cells through FcεRI plays an important role in acute allergic reactions. However, little is known about the function of mast cells in patients with chronic allergic inflammation or the effect of repeated FcεRI triggering occurring in such responses. We aimed to identify changes in mast cell function after repeated FcεRI triggering and to correlate these changes to chronic allergic responses in tissue. Human cord blood-derived mast cells were treated for 2\\xa0weeks with anti-IgE. The function of naive or treated mast cells was analyzed by means of RNA sequencing, quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional assays. Protein secretion was measured with ELISAs and multiplex assays. We observed several changes in mast cell function after repeated anti-IgE triggering. Although the acute response was dampened, we identified 289 genes significantly upregulated after repeated anti-IgE. Most of these genes (84%) were not upregulated after a single anti-IgE stimulus, indicating a significantly different response mode characterized by increased antigen presentation, response to bacteria, and chemotaxis. Changes in mast cell function were related to changes in expression of the transcription factors RXRA and BATF and others. Importantly, we found a substantial overlap between genes upregulated after repeated anti-IgE triggering and genes upregulated in tissue from patients with chronic allergy, in particular those of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.', 'title IgE/Ag-stimulated mast cells release various pro-allergic inflammatory mediators, including histamine, eicosanoids, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. NecroX-5, a cell permeable necrosis inhibitor, showed cytoprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models. However, the anti-allergic effect of NecroX-5 has not yet been investigated. The aims of this study were to evaluate the anti-allergic activity of NecroX-5 in vivo and to investigate the underlying mechanism in vitro. The anti-allergic activity of NecroX-5 was evaluated in vitro using bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and IgE receptor-bearing RBL-2H3 or KU812 cells and in vivo using a mouse model of passive anaphylaxis. The levels of histamine, eicosanoids (PGD2 and LTC4 ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured using enzyme immunoassay kits. The mechanism underlying the action of NecroX-5 was investigated using immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and gene knockdown techniques. NecroX-5 markedly inhibited mast cell degranulation and the synthesis of eicosanoids, TNF-α, and IL-6 by suppressing the activation of Syk, LAT, phospholipase Cγ1, MAP kinases, the Akt/NF-κB pathway, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization via the activation of phosphatase SHP-1. Oral administration of NecroX-5 effectively suppressed mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous and systemic anaphylactic reactions in a dose-dependent manner.', 'title Mast cell-derived mediators mediate several of the pathological features of asthma. Microbial infections induce asthma exacerbations in which the contribution of mast cells remains incomprehensible. In this study we have investigated the characteristic expression pattern of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1-9 and the effect of TLR ligand treatment on IgE-receptor mediated mast cell reactivity. For the studies we employed in vitro differentiated connective tissue like mast cells (CTLMC) and mucosal like mast cells (MLMC) from mice. Both phenotypes were treated for 24 h or 96 h with ligands for TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR3 and TLR4, before activation with IgE and antigen. Prolonged exposure (96 h) with TLR-ligands promoted mast cell reactivity following IgE-receptor activation. TLR4 activation with LPS generated the most pronounced effect, with an enhanced degranulation and secretion of leukotrienes, cytokines and chemokines, in both CTLMC and MLMC. The effect of LPS was mediated through a Myd88-dependent pathway and the increased effect involved JNK-dependent pathway.', 'title In addition to their well-known role as potent effector cells in patients with allergic disease, mast cells have important immunomodulatory roles regulating tolerance in allograft rejection models. The roles of mast cells in oral tolerance development have not previously been examined. We sought to evaluate the importance of mast cells, IgE-mediated mast cell activation, and histamine receptor 1 or 2 blockade on oral tolerance development in mice. Oral tolerance was assessed in 2 mast cell-deficient murine strains (Kit(W-sh/W-sh) and Kit(W/W-v) mice) and control mice. Mice were fed ovalbumin (OVA) or peanut butter for 1 week and then immunized and boosted with relevant protein antigens. Antibody responses were assessed by using ELISA. The oral antihistamines pyrilamine and ranitidine were administered during tolerance induction to OVA. IgE-mediated mast cell activation was initiated during oral tolerance induction or OVA immunization. OVA-specific regulatory T\\xa0cells were assessed in the Peyer patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleens by using flow cytometry after adoptive transfer. Oral tolerance was successfully induced to OVA and peanut butter in mast cell-deficient mice. Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice had higher proportions of antigen-specific regulatory T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes than mast cell-containing control mice. However, mast cell reconstitution studies suggested this effect was mast cell independent. Oral antihistamine treatments with pyrilamine or ranitidine did not impair tolerance and neither did IgE-mediated activation.', 'title When sensitized epicutaneously and challenged orally with ovalbumin, Balb/c mice develop allergen-induced diarrhea. As mast cells play important roles in diarrhea, we studied whether allergic diarrhea could be alleviated with imatinib mesylate. Balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin and treated orally with imatinib. Cytokine mRNA expressions were determined with quantitative RT-PCR and numbers of small intestinal mast cells determined by staining for chloroacetate esterase and mucosal mast cell protease-1. Immunofluorescence staining was used to assess the intestinal CCL1 expression. Ovalbumin-sensitized and challenged Balb/c mice developed diarrhea, which was associated with increased number of mast cells and expression of interleukin (IL)-4 and -13, and chemokines CCL1 and CCL17 in the small intestine. Treatment with imatinib reduced the incidence of diarrhea, inhibited the development of mastocytosis and jejunal mRNA expression of IL-13, CCL1, CCL17 and CCL22. Mast cell-deficient W/W(-V) mice, and surprisingly, also their mast cell-competent control (+/+) littermates failed to develop diarrhea as a response to ovalbumin. This strain-dependent difference was associated with the inability of +/+ and W/W(-V) mice to increase the number of intestinal mast cells and expression of IL-4, IL-13, CCL1 and CCL17 after ovalbumin challenge.', 'title Allergen-mediated cross-linking of IgE on mast cells/basophils is a well-recognized trigger for type 1 allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis (AR). However, allergens may not be the sole trigger for AR, and several allergic-like reactions are induced by non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. We sought to describe a novel non-IgE-mediated, endotoxin-triggered nasal type-1-hypersensitivity-like reaction in mice. To investigate whether endotoxin affects sneezing responses, mice were intraperitoneally immunized with ovalbumin (OVA), then nasally challenged with endotoxin-free or endotoxin-containing OVA. To investigate the role of T\\xa0cells and mechanisms of the endotoxin-induced response, mice were adoptively transferred with in\\xa0vitro-differentiated OVA-specific T Endotoxin-containing, but not endotoxin-free, OVA elicited sneezing responses in mice independent from IgE-mediated signaling. OVA-specific T', 'title Mast cells play important roles in allergic inflammatory responses because they produce leukotrienes (LTs), prostaglandins (PGs), and a variety of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, pharmacological interventions for allergies have focused on inhibiting mast cell activation. Homoisoflavanone (HIF), isolated from Cremastra appendiculata Makino, has anti-angiogenic activities; however, its effects on allergic reactions have not been determined. The aim of this study was to assess the inhibitory effects of HIF on mast cell activation, which is critical for anti-allergic reaction and the underlying mechanisms. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses, and degranulation assay were performed to measure pro-inflammatory and allergic mediators in PMA/A23187- or IgE/antigen-stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), HMC-1, RBL-1, or human PBMC-derived mast cells treated with or without HIF. The anti-allergic effects of HIF were determined in mouse models using dinitrophenol-immunoglobulin E-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and compound 48/80-induced ear swelling. Homoisoflavanone down-regulated PGD2 , LTB4 , and LTC4 production and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in PMA/A23187- or IgE/antigen-stimulated mast cells. The molecular mechanisms by which HIF caused these inhibitory effects were determined to be the inactivation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signaling and the concurrent suppression of cPLA2 . HIF inhibited IgE-mediated PCA and compound 48/80-induced ear swelling in mouse.', 'title Mast cells are involved in allergy and inflammation by secreting multiple mediators including histamine, cytokines and platelet-activating factor. Certain histamine 1 receptor antagonists have been reported to inhibit histamine secretion, but the effect on cytokine release from human mast cells triggered by allergic and other stimuli is not well known. We investigated the ability of rupatadine, a potent histamine 1 receptor antagonist that also blocks platelet-activating factor actions, to also inhibit mast cell mediator release. Rupatadine (1-50 microM) was used before stimulation by: (1) interleukin (IL)-1 to induce IL-6 from human leukemic mast cells (HMC-1 cells), (2) substance P for histamine, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor release from LAD2 cells, and (3) IgE/anti-IgE for cytokine release from human cord blood-derived cultured mast cells. Mediators were measured in the supernatant fluid by ELISA or by Milliplex microbead arrays. Rupatadine (10-50 microM) inhibited IL-6 release (80% at 50 microM) from HMC-1 cells, whether added 10 min or 24 h prior to stimulation. Rupatadine (10-50 microM for 10 min) inhibited IL-8 (80%), vascular endothelial growth factor (73%) and histamine (88%) release from LAD2 cells, as well as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor release from human cord blood-derived cultured mast cells.']"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of bacterial colonization with S. aureus in the nose of subjects with and without chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and to correlate these findings with the severity of symptoms and the extent of the disease. Open, prospective controlled trial. 190 subjects with CRS and 42 subjects with septal deviation without sinusitis (control subjects) were included in this study. Swabs were taken endoscopically from the middle meatus and bacteria were cultured and identified. Airway symptoms were assessed by subjects in standardized questionnaires and frequencies of respiratory tract infections were noted. The rhinosinusitis extent was graded by CT scan assessment. Analysis of variance, chi-square test, and Pearson's correlation test were applied for statistical analyses. The S. aureus carriage rate was 25.5% in CRS and 31.4% in control subjects. Further facultative pathogens were cultured in 20.6% of subjects with CRS and in 8.5% of controls. 73.8% of S. aureus were ampicillin-resistant, multiresistant strains were cultured in 5.8%. Most airway symptoms and the frequencies of respiratory tract infections were significantly higher in the CRS group compared with control subjects. In post hoc comparison between the subgroups with and without S. aureus colonization, no significant differences were found between the extent of rhinosinusitis and the severity of airway symptoms.\", 'title Allergen avoidance is important for allergic rhinitis management. However, studies evaluating the efficiency of avoidance measures from pollens are lacking.

We wished to analyze the presenting symptoms in allergic rhinitis, as well as their relationship with quality of life (QoL) and therapeutic outcomes. Presenting symptoms and QoL were assessed using the Optum™ SF-12v2(®) Health Survey in 260 patients with allergic rhinitis. Clinical response at 3 months after treatment was measured. Ten most common symptoms presenting with at least moderate severity in allergic rhinitis were: blocked nose (82.7%), rhinorrhea (75.0%), sneeze (70.9%), itchy nose (68.5%), fatigue (63.6%), mouth breathing (61.1%), daytime somnolence (52.7%), postnasal drip (49.1%), itchy eyes (47.3%), and dry mouth (46.3%). Severity of sneeze was correlated with physical component summary (PCS) whereas postnasal drip and daytime somnolence were correlated with mental component summary (MCS). Severity of dry mouth was correlated with PCS and MCS. The symptoms with the highest severity scores after treatment were blocked nose, postnasal drip, fatigue, and dry mouth, respectively.', 'title Patient and physician perspectives on the impact of allergic rhinitis have previously been studied in the general population. We evaluated the burden of allergic rhinitis among patients from the members of European allergy patient organizations.

Background information on allergic rhinitis, severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms and their impact on lives, nonmedical measures for relieving of symptoms, types of medications, and concomitant conditions were evaluated. Almost 50% of the responders reported symptoms lasting for more than a season. Preventive household adjustments are expensive with little perceived benefit. Sleep and emotional life are affected by allergic rhinitis. Most patients are satisfied with the current allergic rhinitis medications; at least one-fifth report dissatisfaction. Patients perceive that allergic rhinitis worsens other concomitant allergic diseases.', 'title Symptoms of allergic rhinitis are accompanied by infiltration of the nasal mucosa with inflammatory cells, predominantly eosinophils and metachromatic cells (basophils and mast cells). Specific immunotherapy (IT) reduces mucosal eosinophilia and numbers of metachromatic cells in the epithelium. A specific marker distinguishing basophils from mast cells was recently developed. The basophil-specific monoclonal antibody 2D7 was used to determine the influence of subcutaneous IT on numbers of nasal mucosal basophils compared with the effects of IT on neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells. During a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of grass pollen IT in 44 adults with severe summer hay fever, nasal biopsies were taken at baseline, out of the pollen season, and at the peak of the pollen season following 2 years treatment. Biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry for basophils (2D7+), mast cells (AA1+), eosinophils (MBP+) and neutrophils (neutrophil elastase+). In placebo-treated (PL) patients there were significant seasonal increases in basophils (P < 0.01), mast cells (P < 0.05) and eosinophils (P = 0.002) in the nasal submucosa. In IT-treated patients significant increases in 2D7+ cells (P < 0.01) and eosinophils (P = 0.01) but not AA1+ cells (P = 0.9) were observed. These differences were significant between groups for eosinophils (P < 0.05). In the epithelium there were seasonal increases in AA1+ cells and eosinophils in both groups (PL: P < 0.01, IT: P < 0.05 for both). The between-group difference was significant for eosinophils (P = 0.05). Basophils were observed in the epithelium of six out of 17 in the placebo group and one out of 20 in the IT group (P = 0.03). Neutrophil numbers remained constant in both epithelium and submucosa.', 'title Seasonal allergic rhinitis constitutes an excellent in vivo model of an allergic mucosal inflammatory reaction. This offers the opportunity of studying the fundamentals of allergic inflammation in addition to improvement of knowledge on the basal pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. So far, monitoring methods of disease activity and treatment efficacy have mainly been based upon subjective assessments, illustrating the impact of introducing reliable objective methods. To investigate the allergic inflammatory reaction of seasonal rhinitis through different objective methods and evaluate these as indicators of disease activity and treatment efficacy. Functional parameters, i.e. acoustic rhinometry and nasal metacholine challenge, and biological markers, i.e. blood eosinophil count, eosinophil cationic protein in serum (s-ECP) and nasal lavage fluid (n-ECP), were assessed before and at peak pollen season in 27 patients with grass pollen induced rhinitis. Patients were randomized to either nasal corticosteroid or placebo treatment and recorded nasal symptom scores. Acoustic rhinometry revealed a significant difference in favour of steroid treatment (P < 0.05) comparing nasal volumes before and during season. This difference primarily relied upon a decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.05). A reduction from baseline of s-ECP in the steroid group (P < 0.01) was obtained. N-ECP demonstrated a difference between treatment groups, although not significant. Symptom scores increased in all patients during the pollen season, although this was only significant in the placebo treated patients (P < 0.01).

We examined cohort-specific and combined associations of residential greenness with allergic rhinitis and aeroallergen sensitization based on individual data from Swedish (BAMSE), Australian (MACS), Dutch (PIAMA), Canadian (CAPPS and SAGE), and German (GINIplus and LISAplus) birth cohorts (n = 13 016). Allergic rhinitis (doctor diagnosis/symptoms) and aeroallergen sensitization were assessed in children aged 6-8 years in six cohorts and 10-12 years in five cohorts. Residential greenness was defined as the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in a 500-m buffer around the home address at the time of health assessment. Cohort-specific associations per 0.2 unit increase in NDVI were assessed using logistic regression models and combined in a random-effects meta-analysis. Greenness in a 500-m buffer was positively associated with allergic rhinitis at 6-8 years in BAMSE (odds ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [1.13, 1.79]) and GINI/LISA South (1.69 [1.19, 2.41]) but inversely associated in GINI/LISA North (0.61 [0.36, 1.01]) and PIAMA (0.67 [0.47, 0.95]).

Twelve volunteers without allergy served as controls. Preseasonally, patients and controls performed equally in discrimination and identification testing, but not in threshold testing. No changes were found in the controls, but a significant decrease in threshold and identification from the 7th day of the season in patients with allergy was noted that was better correlated to ECP than to NVF. NVF was already maximally decreased from the 3rd intraseasonal day with no further changes. ECP increase became significant at day 14.', 'title Allergic rhinitis is a common disease, in which some patients will deteriorate or develop asthma. It is important to characterize these patients, thereby offering the possibility for prevention. This study evaluated eosinophil parameters as potential indicators of deteriorating allergic airway disease. The subjects of the study included all patients who suffered seasonal allergic rhinitis and had participated in a study 6 years earlier, in which blood eosinophils, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) serum eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), nasal lavage ECP and nasal lavage EPO levels were measured. Patients in the present study were interviewed on occurrence of rhinitis symptoms during the last season, rhinitis outside season, asthma-like symptoms and asthma diagnosis, and were skin-prick tested for common aeroallergens. Eosinophil parameters from the study 6 years earlier were then tested for the ability to predict occurrence of new allergies, worsening of rhinitis and occurrence of asthma. Forty-four patients participated in the study. In four patients seasonal rhinitis symptoms had deteriorated, 10 had experienced perennial rhinitis symptoms, 14 reported asthma-like symptoms and seven had been diagnosed with asthma. Thirteen had developed additional sensitization. Patients developing asthma-like symptoms compared with patients with no such symptoms had significantly higher serum ECP (16.7 microg/l vs 8.2 microg/l; P < or = 0.01) and serum EPO (17.9 microg/l vs 8.8 microg/l; P < or = 0.05). Results were similar, considering patients diagnosed with asthma. Blood eosinophils and nasal lavage parameters were not related to development of asthma and asthma-like symptoms. No eosinophil parameter was related to deterioration of rhinitis or additional sensitization.']"

ELA-A2 peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were used in the assays as a positive control. Antisera from all four horses injected with MHC-mismatched MSCs contained antibodies that caused the death of ELA-A2 haplotype MSCs in the microcytotoxicity assays. In two of the four horses, antibodies were present as early as day 7 post-injection. MSC death was consistently equivalent to that of ELA-A2 haplotype PBL death at all time points and antisera dilutions. Antisera from the control horse that was injected with MHC-matched MSCs did not contain cytotoxic ELA-A2 antibodies at any of the time points examined.",

         "['title The inability of porcine thrombomodulin (TM) to activate human anticoagulant protein C after pig-to-human xenotransplantation may lead to an aberrant activation of coagulation with microthrombosis and ultimately failure of the transplanted organ. Here, we describe the production of triple-transgenic pigs expressing hCD59/DAF and human thrombomodulin (hTM) and tested hTM-transgenic fibroblasts obtained from these pigs for their ability to activate human protein C in a new in vitro assay. Fibroblast cell cultures were established from a hCD59/DAF transgenic pig and transfected with a vector coding for hTM under transcriptional control of the CMV promoter. Transfected cells were analyzed for integration and expression of the hTM vector by PCR and RT-PCR. One cell clone was used as donor for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce triple transgenic (CD59/DAF/hTM) pigs. Pigs were characterized in detail with regard to hTM integration and expression by PCR, RT-PCR, Northern blot, Western blot, immunostaining, and FACS analysis. Fibroblasts from hTM-transgenic pigs were analyzed in a new in vitro hTM coactivity assay to assess the production of activated protein C (aPC) and results were compared to those from wild-type controls. In total, 1040 cloned transgenic embryos were transferred to eight recipients. Five recipients remained pregnant and delivered 22 piglets. Expression of hTM was detected in all xenorelavant organs including heart, liver, kidney, lung, and pancreas. The lowest levels of expression were found in lung and liver while all animals showed a strong, but frequently patchy expression pattern of hTM in heart, kidney, and pancreas. The hTM cofactor activity (ranging on a scale from 5-18 U/10(5) cells/2h) was significantly higher in fibroblasts of hTM-transgenic clones compared to wild-type porcine fibroblasts (1.7 U/10(5) cells/2h).', 'title Acute vascular rejection in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation involves recognition and damage of porcine (po) endothelial cells (EC) by human (hu) leukocytes, probably including natural killer (NK) cells. To study such interactions we analyzed rolling and static adhesion of hu NK cells to po EC. The effects of blocking hu and po adhesion molecules on the adhesion hu NK cells to po EC monolayers was analyzed under shear stress (10 min, 37 degrees C, 0.7 dynes/cm2) or under static conditions (10 min, 37 degrees C). All used cell populations were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Blocking of CD106 on po EC or its ligand CD49d on hu NK cells decreased rolling adhesion of both fresh and activated hu NK cells by more than 75%. Masking of CD62L on fresh but not activated hu NK resulted in a 44% decrease in rolling adhesion, in line with the diminished cell surface expression of CD62L upon activation. Antibodies to CD31, CD54, CD62E, and CD62P on EC or CD11a, CD18, and CD162 on NK cells had only minor effects on rolling adhesion. The adhesion of the FcgammaRIII- hu NK cell line NK92 to po EC was inhibited by 95% after masking po CD106 whereas antibodies to po CD31, CD54, CD62E, or CD62P had no effect, thereby excluding effects of Fc-receptor-dependent binding of hu NK cells to po EC. Static adhesion of activated NK cells was reduced by approximately 60% by blocking either CD49d or CD106, by 47% by blocking CD11a, and by 82% upon simultaneous blocking of CD11a and CD49d.', \"title This study tested the hypothesis that Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) incompatible equine mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would induce cytotoxic antibodies to donor MHC antigens in recipient horses after intradermal injection. No studies to date have explored recipient antibody responses to allogeneic donor MSC transplantation in the horse. This information is critical because the horse is a valuable species for assessing the safety and efficacy of MSC treatment prior to human clinical application. Six MHC heterozygote horses were identified as non-ELA-A2 haplotype by microsatellite typing and used as allogeneic MHC-mismatched MSC recipients. MHC homozygote horses of known ELA-A2 haplotype were used as MSC and peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) donors. One MHC homozygote horse of the ELA-A2 haplotype was the recipient of ELA-A2 donor MSCs as an MHC-matched control. Donor MSCs, which were previously isolated and immunophenotyped, were thawed and culture expanded to achieve between 30x10(6) and 50x10(6) cells for intradermal injection into the recipient's neck. Recipient serum was collected and tested for the presence of anti-donor antibodies prior to MSC injection and every 7\\xa0days after MSC injection for the duration of the 8-week study using the standard two-stage lymphocyte microcytotoxicity dye-exclusion test. In addition to anti-ELA-A2 antibodies, recipient serum was examined for the presence of cross-reactive antibodies including anti-ELA-A3 and anti-RBC antibodies. All MHC-mismatched recipient horses produced anti-ELA-A2 antibodies following injection of ELA-A2 MSCs and developed a wheal at the injection site that persisted for the duration of the experiment. Anti-ELA-A2 antibody responses were varied both in terms of strength and timing. Four recipient horses had high-titered anti-ELA-A2 antibody responses resulting in greater than 80% donor PBL death in the microcytotoxicity assays and one of these horses also developed antibodies that cross-reacted when tested on lymphocyte targets from a horse with an unrelated MHC type.\", 'title B-cell depletion significantly extends survival of α-1,3-galactosyltranferase knockout (GTKO) porcine organs in pig-to-primate models. Our previous work demonstrated that the anti-non-Gal xenoantibody response is structurally restricted. Selective inhibition of xenoantigen/xenoantibody interactions could prolong xenograft survival while preserving B-cell-mediated immune surveillance. The anti-idiotypic antibody, B4N190, was selected from a synthetic human phage display library after enrichment against a recombinant anti-non-Gal xenoantibody followed by functional testing in vitro. The inhibitory small molecule, JMS022, was selected from the NCI diversity set III using virtual screening based on predicted xenoantibody structure. Three rhesus monkeys were pre-treated with anti-non-Gal-specific single-chain anti-idiotypic antibody, B4N190. A total of five monkeys, including two untreated controls, were then immunized with GTKO porcine endothelial cells to initiate an anti-non-α-1,3-Gal (non-Gal) xenoantibody response. The efficacy of the inhibitory small molecule specific for anti-non-Gal xenoantibody, JMS022, was tested in vitro. After the combination of in vivo anti-id and in vitro small molecule treatments, IgM xenoantibody binding to GTKO cells was reduced to pre-immunization levels in two-thirds of animals; however, some xenoantibodies remained in the third animal. Furthermore, when treated with anti-id alone, all three experimental animals displayed a lower anti-non-Gal IgG xenoantibody response compared with controls. Treatment with anti-idiotypic antibody alone reduced IgM xenoantibody response intensity in only one of three monkeys injected with GTKO pig endothelial cells. In the one experimental animal, which displayed reduced IgM and IgG responses, select B-cell subsets were also reduced by anti-id therapy alone. Furthermore, natural antibody responses, including anti-laminin, anti-ssDNA, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were intact despite targeted depletion of anti-non-Gal xenoantibodies in vivo indicating that selective reduction of xenoantibodies can be accomplished without total B-cell depletion.', 'title To compare innate immune responses of peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy and asymptomatic heaves-affected horses. Heaves-affected horses (n=5-6) and healthy controls (n=4-5) kept under low dust environments (pasture or shavings and pellets). Blood neutrophil and neutrophil-depleted cell populations were isolated using MACS system. Cells were incubated with or without bacterial products (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 100 ng/mL and fMLP, 5 ng/mL, 5 h). Cytokine (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF, IL-4, INFγ and IL-10) and receptor (TLR4) mRNA expression was assessed by qPCR. TNF concentration in culture supernatants and serum samples was assessed using equine specific ELISA. Apoptotic rate of resting and stimulated neutrophils was assessed by flow cytometry using AnnexinV and 7-AAD (18 h) and correlated with early pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the same cells (5 h). Stimulation with bacterial-derived products resulted in overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both neutrophils (IL-1β and TNF) and neutrophil-depleted leukocytes (IL-1β and IL-8) from heaves-affected horses. Neutrophil survival (18 h) was associated with their early TNF expression, but not IL-8. Neutrophil-depleted leukocytes from these horses also had significantly increased basal TNF mRNA levels. Serum TNF concentration was also significantly higher in heaves-affected horses compared to healthy horses kept in similar environment.', 'title For clinical xenotransplantation of pig organs to be successful, the significant barriers of host cellular immunity against the pig will need to be overcome. Natural killer (NK) cells appear to play an important role in rejection of discordant xenografts, and IL-2 activated human NK cells are cytotoxic to human endothelium. We addressed the role of IL-2 activated human and baboon NK cells in the primate immune response to pig xenoantigens in vivo and in vitro. Human natural killer (NK) cells were isolated from pooled human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) using density gradient centrifugation method. Phenotype of isolated cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. Purified NK cells were than tasted for spontaneous and IL-2 augmented adhesion and lysis of cultured pig aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) monolayers in a short-term 51 Cr-release assay. The effects of human macrophage derived cytokines TNF alpha and IL-1 on adhesion of IL-2 activated NK cells were studied. Human NK cells demonstrate prominent adherent and lytic activity against pig endothelium, which can be significantly augmented by IL-2. Macrophage derived cytokines can further augment the adherent properties of these NK cells.', 'title Effective improvement in xenograft survival is achieved using transplants from transgenic pigs expressing human complement (C) regulatory proteins, including decay-accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and CD46 on endothelial cells (ECs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether human DAF expression in porcine ECs, as well as regulating C activation, can modify intercellular events through its interaction with its receptor, CD97, on human leukocytes. Cellular interactions between human leukocytes and porcine ECs were investigated in vitro using ECs from either wild-type or DAF-transgenic pigs. Static leukocyte adhesion and T cell activation assays were performed using porcine ECs as target or effector cells, respectively. The role of the DAF-CD97 interaction was investigated using specific blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human DAF and its receptor, CD97, in adhesion assays. Adhesion of U937 or Jurkat T cells, both expressing human DAF and CD97, was quantitatively similar for wild-type and transgenic-DAF-expressing pig ECs. Furthermore, blocking the CD97-DAF interaction did not inhibit xenogeneic leukocyte-endothelium adhesion, whereas blocking the very late antigen 4-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 pathway reduced this adhesion by 50-80%. Furthermore, DAF and CD97 expression was not up-regulated during tumor necrosis factor-alpha- or lipopolysaccharide-mediated EC activation, unlike the adhesion molecules E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1.', 'title The ability of T cells from pigs, the most suitable donors for clinical xenotransplantation, to induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and to facilitate hematopoietic cell engraftment in highly disparate xenogeneic recipients remains unclear. In this article, the authors address these questions in a presensitized pig-to-mouse transplantation model using porcine cytokine-transgenic mice. Swine donors were presensitized by mouse skin grafting and boosted by the injection of mouse cells after the skin graft was rejected. Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes were collected at various times after mouse skin grafting, and their potential to induce GVHD and to facilitate donor hematopoietic cell engraftment in conditioned murine recipients was evaluated. Presensitization of donor pigs resulted in marked enhancement of anti-mouse responses, as reflected in augmented anti-mouse mixed lymphocyte responses, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody production. However, injection of high numbers of PBMC and splenocytes (>1 x 10(8)) with bone marrow cells from the presensitized pigs failed to induce detectable GVHD or long-term chimerism in mice that were treated with depleting anti-T-cell and natural killer cell antibodies, cobra venom factor, medronate-liposomes, and 4 Gy of whole-body and 7 Gy of thymic irradiation. Histologic analysis revealed no mononuclear cell infiltration or GVHD-associated lesions in the liver, intestine, lungs, or skin of the mouse recipients. Furthermore, the recipient mice had no detectable T cells or anti-pig immunoglobulin G antibodies in the blood by 6 weeks after injection of porcine cells.', 'title Efficient and precise techniques for the genetic modification of pigs facilitate the generation of tailored donor animals for xenotransplantation. Numerous transgenic pig lines exist with the focus on inhibition of the complement system and of humoral immune responses. In addition, immune cell-based responses need to be controlled to prevent pig-to-primate xenograft rejection. Expression of human (hu) TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on porcine cells has the potential to ameliorate human T cell responses. We generated transgenic pigs expressing human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (huTRAIL) under the control of either the mouse H2K(b) promoter or a CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter, the latter one (CAG-huTRAIL) on a GGTA1 knockout/huCD46 transgenic background. The biological activity of huTRAIL was demonstrated by its apoptosis-inducing effect on Jurkat lymphoma cells. To clarify whether huTRAIL affects also primary immune cells and whether its effects depend on the presence of co-stimulatory molecules, we exposed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or isolated T cells to huTRAIL-expressing porcine fibroblasts or dendritic cells in vitro. H2Kb-huTRAIL transgenic pigs express huTRAIL mainly in the spleen and secondary lymphoid tissues. The CAG-huTRAIL construct facilitated huTRAIL expression in multiple organs, the level being at least one order of magnitude higher than in H2Kb-huTRAIL transgenic pigs. Incubation with huTRAIL-expressing H2Kb-huTRAIL transgenic porcine dendritic cells decreased human T cell proliferation significantly without any signs of apoptosis. In spite of the high transgene expression level, CAG-huTRAIL transgenic fibroblasts did not affect proliferation of human PBMC, independent of their activation state.', 'title Transgenic expression of human thrombomodulin (hTBM), which has the potential to solve the problem of coagulation dysregulation in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation, may have additional benefits by neutralizing the proinflammatory cytokine high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). The aim of this study was to investigate HMGB1-mediated effects on porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) from wild-type (WT) and hTBM transgenic pigs. Porcine aortic endothelial cells were treated with HMGB1, human (h)TNFα or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Procoagulant and proinflammatory responses were assessed by measuring expression of cell surface markers (adhesion molecules, fibrinogen-like protein 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1), secretion of porcine cytokines and chemokines (HMGB1, TNFα, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1), and formation of PAI-1/tissue plasminogen activator complexes. Thrombin-mediated degradation of HMGB1 in the presence of PAEC was examined by Western blot and functional assay. High-mobility group box 1 potently activated WT PAEC, increasing the expression of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, fibrinogen-like protein 2, and PAI-1, the secretion of TNFα, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the formation of PAI-1/tissue plasminogen activator complexes. Human TNFα- or LPS-induced activation of WT PAEC was inhibited by treatment with rabbit anti-HMGB1 antibody. Transgenic expression of hTBM significantly reduced the activation of PAEC by HMGB1 or hTNFα, and significantly enhanced thrombin-induced HMGB1 cleavage. Chemically induced shedding of the lectin-like domain of TBM resulted in significantly increased HMGB1-induced PAEC activation.']"

This is the first study on time and frequency resolved fronto-posterior coherence during cognitive control in schizophrenia. We examined 16 schizophrenic/schizoaffective patients and 20 age-matched controls performing a choice-reaction task. Fronto-posterior coherence was analyzed for event-related increases with respect to the inter-trial interval. Furthermore, we compared the two groups for event-related coherence during the task-related time intervals which showed a significant coherence increase with respect to the inter-trial interval, as well as for absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. Event-related coherence was significantly reduced in patients during time intervals (0-250 ms poststimulus) when controls showed significant event-related coherence increases. However, patients showed significantly higher absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. These results pointed to differential deficits in fronto-posterior connectivity during the inter-trial interval and task-related conditions in schizophrenia.', 'title Schizophrenia has been conceptualized as a disorder of integration of neural activity across distributed networks. However, the relationship between specific symptom dimensions and patterns of functional connectivity remains unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH), a particularly prevalent and clinically relevant symptom in schizophrenia, and functional connectivity of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 27 schizophrenia patients with AVH and 27 matched control subjects. We calculated correlations reflecting functional connectivity between a priori defined regions-of-interest and the bilateral TPJ seed regions, comprising the neural network involved in inner speech processes and AVH. Compared with healthy control subjects, schizophrenia patients showed reduced functional connectivity between left TPJ and the right homotope of Broca. Within the patient group, more severe AVH were associated with reduced neural coupling between left TPJ and bilateral anterior cingulate as well as the bilateral amygdala.', 'title Abnormal synchronization of brain oscillations is found to be associated with various core symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the underlying mechanism of this association remains yet to be elucidated. In this study, we found that coupled local and global feedback (CLGF) circuits in the cortical functional network are related to the abnormal synchronization and also correlated to the negative symptom of schizophrenia. Analysis of the magnetoencephalography data obtained from patients with chronic schizophrenia during rest revealed an increase in beta band synchronization and a reduction in gamma band power compared to healthy controls. Using a feedback identification method based on non-causal impulse responses, we constructed functional feedback networks and found that CLGF circuits were significantly reduced in schizophrenia. From computational analysis on the basis of the Wilson-Cowan model, we unraveled that the CLGF circuits are critically involved in the abnormal synchronization and the dynamical switching between beta and gamma bands power in schizophrenia. Moreover, we found that the abundance of CLGF circuits was negatively correlated with the development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, suggesting that the negative symptom is closely related to the impairment of this circuit.', 'title Schizophrenia is hypothesized to involve disordered connectivity between brain regions. Currently, there are no direct measures of brain connectivity; functional and structural connectivity used separately provide only limited insight. Simultaneous measure of anatomical and functional connectivity and its interactions allow for better understanding of schizophrenia-related alternations in brain connectivity. Twenty-seven schizophrenia patients and 27 healthy control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Separate functional and anatomical connectivity maps were calculated and combined for each subject. Global, regional, and voxel measures and K-means network analysis were employed to identify group differences and correlation with clinical symptoms. A global connectivity analysis indicated that patients had lower anatomical connectivity and lower coherence between the two imaging modalities. In schizophrenia these group differences correlated with clinical symptom severity. Although anatomical connectivity nearly uniformly decreased, functional connectivity in schizophrenia was lower for some connections (e.g., middle temporal gyrus) and higher for others (e.g., cingulate and thalamus). Within the default mode network (DMN) two separate subsystems can be identified. Schizophrenia patients showed decoupling between structural and functional connectivity that can be localized to networks originating in posterior cingulate cortex as well as in the task-positive network and one of the DMN components.', 'title Many studies have separately reported abnormalities of frontal and temporal lobe structures in schizophrenia, but little is known of structural fronto-temporal associations in this condition. We investigated whether male patients with chronic schizophrenia would show abnormal patterns of correlation between regional brain volumes. Structural magnetic resonance images of the brain in 42 patients were compared with 43 matched unaffected controls. We explored the pattern of association between regional brain volumes by correlational analyses, and non-parametrically tested for significance of between-group differences by randomization. The schizophrenics demonstrated significant volume deficits in several brain regions (left temporal lobe and hippocampus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and significant volume increases in the ventricular system (third ventricle and left temporal horn of the lateral ventricle). Controls demonstrated large positive correlations (r > 0.4) between prefrontal and temporal lobe regions. By contrast, inter-regional correlations significantly reduced in schizophrenics included those between prefrontal, anterior cingulate and temporal regions, and between posterior cingulate and hippocampus (P < 0.05). The most salient abnormality in patients was a dissociation between prefrontal and superior temporal gyrus volumes (P < 0.01).', 'title There is increasing evidence that the frequently reported working memory impairments in schizophrenia might be partly due to an alteration in the functional connectivity between task-relevant areas. However, little is known about the functional connectivity patterns in schizophrenia patients during learning processes. In a previous study, Koch et al. [Neuroscience (2007) 146, 1474-1483] have demonstrated stronger exponential activation decreases in schizophrenia patients during overlearning of short-term memory material. The question arises whether these differential temporal patterns of activation in schizophrenia patients and controls are going along with changes in task-related functional connectivity. Therefore, in the current study, 13 patients with schizophrenia and 13 controls were studied while performing a short-term memory task associated with increasing overlearning of verbal stimulus material. Functional connectivity was investigated by analyses of psychophysiological interactions (PPI). Results revealed significant task-related modulation of functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a network including the right DLPFC, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, right inferior parietal cortex, left and right cerebellum as well as the left occipital lobe in patients during the course of overlearning and practice. No significant PPI results were detectable in controls.', 'title The anterior cingulate cortex plays a central role in altered processes of cognitive control in schizophrenia. However, the cortical foundations of disturbed anterior cingulate cognitive activation are poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigated the association of anterior cingulate cognitive activation and cortical thickness in schizophrenia combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and surface-based morphometry. Fifty-three patients with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV and 53 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were included and underwent fMRI and high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. fMRI data was analyzed using SPM5. Cortical thickness was calculated using an automated computerized algorithm (Freesurfer Software). Statistical cortical maps were created correlating anterior cingulate activation and cortical thickness on a node-by-node basis covering the entire cortex in schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. Patients demonstrated a significantly reduced anterior cingulate cognitive activation. Significantly differing associations of anterior cingulate activation and cortical thickness were found in a pattern of dorsolateral prefrontal, superior frontal-anterior cingulate, and superior temporal cortical regions, where patients but not healthy control subjects demonstrated a significant association of reduced anterior cingulate activation and cortical thinning. A direct comparison of cortical thickness between the diagnostic groups revealed a significantly reduced cortical thickness of these prefrontotemporal regions in schizophrenia.', 'title Previous studies imply that interhemispheric disconnectivity plays a more important role on information processing in schizophrenia. However, the role of the aberrant interhemispheric connection in the pathophysiology of this disorder remains unclear. Recently, resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has reported to have potentials of mapping functional interactions between pairs of brain hemispheres. Resting-state whole-brain functional connectivity analyses were performed on 41 schizophrenia patients and 33 healthy controls. The first-episode schizophrenia patients showed significant aberrant interhemispheric connection in the globus pallidus, medial frontal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. The correlation of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores with odds ratio of the aberrant interhemispheric connections revealed positive correlation in the pallidum (rho=0.335, p=.003) and medial frontal gyrus (rho=0.260, p=.025). The connection in the pallidum was also positively correlated with duration of illness (rho=-0.407, p=.009). Whereas, the aberrant interhemispheric connection in the inferior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with scores of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (rho=0.393, p=.012).', 'title Previous studies in schizophrenia have shown a strong relationship between memory deficits and a poor clinical outcome. However, no previous study has identified the functional neural correlates of memory encoding in relation to remission. To determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns differed between individuals that later achieved remission v. those who did not. Forty-two participants with first-episode schizophrenia were divided into two groups after 1 year of treatment as per the 2005 remission in schizophrenia consensus definition. We then examined fMRI activation using three contrasts (associative v. item-oriented strategy, semantically unrelated v. related image pairs, and successful v. unsuccessful memory encoding) among 15 participants who had achieved remission (remitted group), 27 who had not (non-remitted group) and 31 healthy controls (control group). Participants in the non-remitted group displayed a positive activation in the posterior cingulate compared with those in the remitted group when encoding related images; no significant differences between the two groups were identified for the other contrasts. From the behavioural data, compared with the remitted and control groups, the non-remitted group demonstrated an inability to encode related images and displayed worse recognition memory overall.', 'title There is increasing evidence that functional deficits in schizophrenia may be driven by a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and consistent timing of neural signals. This study examined the extent to which exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and MK801, frequently used pharmacological models of schizophrenia, recreate deficits in electrophysiological markers of disturbed brain circuits that are thought to underlie the illness. Furthermore, this study characterizes the specificity of these differences across the frequency spectrum so as to help identify the nature of selective circuit abnormalities that mediate each oscillatory response as relevant to schizophrenia. Mouse EEG was recorded during exposure to repeated auditory stimuli after injection of either vehicle or drug. The dose-response relationship for each electrophysiological measure was determined for ketamine and MK-801. Time-frequency analyses were performed to assess baseline, total, and evoked power and intertrial coherence (ITC) at low (5-10 Hz) and high (35-80 Hz)-frequencies. High frequency evoked and total power was decreased by MK-801 and ketamine in a dose-dependent fashion. High frequency baseline power was increased by MK-801 and ketamine in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar to evoked power, high frequency inter-trial coherence was dose-dependently decreased by both drugs. Low frequency ITC was only decreased by ketamine.']"

Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985."

         "English Civil War In the 1970s, revisionist historians challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories, notably in the 1973 anthology The Origins of the English Civil War (Conrad Russell ed.). These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, returning to the contingency-based historiography of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that patterns of war allegiance did not fit either Whig or Marxist theories. Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the Glorious Revolution. Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament."

         "William Tecumseh Sherman Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.\""

Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial.

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness."

         "Andrew Jackson Jackson's legacy has been variously used by later presidents. Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution. Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights. The members of the Progressive Party of 1948 to 1955 saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson. Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man, praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff. In 2016, Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman. Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's first presidency, Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021."

         "Andrew Jackson Since James Madison's presidency when Jackson served as war commander, Jackson deployed a hostile attitude against the Indians, in part by ignoring president's mandates to protect the Indian lands of American settlers Madison, who displayed a paternalistic attitude toward the Indians, then joined with the tribes and commended them for leaving their hunter lives and for beginning to be farmers and farmers.[50] [51] Although there are few details, it is known that he joined with the tribes of the south-east and west, which included the Creeks and the Osage. In contrast, Jackson urged the president to ignore Indian pleas In the eight years of his term, Jackson formulated 70 treaties with the Indians in the south and the northwest.[52] Jackson's presidency marked a new era in American politics and Anglo-Indian relations of displacement of native peoples.[53] Jackson himself participated in the bargaining boards with the Indian tribes, although on other occasions he also delegated this assignment to other people. The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminola and Cherokee The northwestern tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa and the Potawatomi Although conflicts between whites and Indians took place anywhere, the problem had worsened in the south where Indian populations were larger. Clashes often took place with native tribes, especially the Creek and Seminola tribes who refused to follow treaties made by their tribes for various reasons.[54] The Second Seminole War began in December 1835, lasted six years, and finally ended under the presidency of John Tyler in August 1842.[54]"

         "Pedro II of Brazil During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper, and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women's rights. On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself."

         "Atlantic slave trade The life expectancy for Brazil's slave plantation's for African descended slaves was around 23 years. The trans-Atlantic slave trade into Brazil was outlawed in 1831. To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro."

However, Napoleon restored him in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending thousands of troops After suffering the losses of two thirds of the men, many due to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803 Napoleon renounced North America and accepted Louisiana's U.S. Purchase In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it an independent state, the Republic of Haiti, the second republic of the New World."

The country made progress in the social and political spheres and all layers of society benefited from reforms and the sharing of growing prosperity.[269] Brazil's international reputation, both for its political stability and for its investment potential, increased considerably and the empire was considered a modern nation.[268] The economy experienced rapid growth and immigration was expanding.

Johannesburg, which had until then been a simple village, became the economic center of South Africa The capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, was filled with precious Victorian buildings and a multitude of families enriched with the new economic boom sent their children to study in the Netherlands, resulting in the emergence of a new refined and educated Afrikaner bourgeoisie."

In 1892 he published an encyclical advising French Catholics to join the Republic and defend the Church by participating in republican politics. This attempt to improve relationships failed.[24]', 'Enrique VIII de Inglaterra The pope responded to these events excommunicating Henry VIII in July 1533. Considerable religious agitation ensued Urged by Thomas Cromwell, Parliament passed several laws that sealed the gap with Rome in the spring of 1534 The Law on Restriction of Appeals[17] prohibited appeals by ecclesiastical courts to the pope He also warned the Church to decree any kind of regulation without the prior consent of the king. The Law of Ecclesiastical Appointments[18] of 1534 decreed that clergymen elected to bishops should be nominated by the sovereign The Law of Supremacy,[19] of the same year, declared that “the king is the only supreme head in the land of the Church of England” The Law of Betrayal,[20] also of 1534, made high treason punishable by death to ignore the authority of the king, among other cases The pope was denied all sources of monetary income, such as the Obolo of St. Peter.', 'Pío IX Other actions worthy of note by this pope are the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception (encyclical Ineffabilis Deus of December 8, 1854) and the convening of the First Vatican Council (1869-1870), where papal infallibility was defined for its pronouncements ex cathedra -circumstance this which occurs on very few occasions - and the strengthening of the Roman primacy (the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Aeternus of July 18, 1870). The Council also collected the thesis of Syllabus and by means of the constitution Dei Filius (De fide catholica) recognized to the Papal Romans the primacy of jurisdiction over all bishops, both individually and collectively considered.', 'Charles III of Spain Charles received the strict and structured education of a Spanish Infante by Giovanni Antonio de Medrano; he was very pious and was often in awe of his domineering mother, who according to many contemporaries, he resembled greatly. The Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo, Doge of Venice and Ambassador of Venice to Naples declared that \"...he received an education removed from all studies and all applications in order to be able to govern himself\" (...tenne sempre un\\'educazione lontanissima da ogni studio e da ogni applicazione per diventare da sé stesso capace di governo).', 'Concilio de Calcedonia The Pope moved all the threads within his grasp to change the situation: he wrote to Emperor Theodosius II, to his sister Pulqueria, a supporter of understanding with Rome, and tried to have the Emperor of the West, Valentinian III, intervene. A deep crisis broke out between Leo I and Dioscorus, Patriarch of Alexandria, who came to excommunicate the pope', 'Charles III of Spain The situation worsened when, in 1735, just a few days before the coronation of Charles, the Pope chose to accept the traditional offering of a Hackney horse from the Holy Roman Emperor rather than from Charles.

In September 2016, Cardinals Raymond Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller and Joachim Meisner wrote a letter to Francis asking him to clarify five claims of Amoris laetitia.[25]', 'Council of Chalcedon According to a letter to the Empress Pulcheria collected among the letters of Leo I, Hilary apologized for not delivering to her the pope\\'s letter after the synod, but owing to Dioscurus, who tried to hinder his going either to Rome or to Constantinople, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. Hilary, who later became pope and dedicated an oratory in the Lateran Basilica in thanks for his life, managed to escape from Constantinople and brought news of the council to Leo who immediately dubbed it a \"synod of robbers\" – Latrocinium – and refused to accept its pronouncements. The decisions of this council now threatened schism between the East and the West.', 'Pope Pius IX Traditionally Catholic Spain offered a challenge to Pius IX as anti-clerical governments came to power in 1832, resulting in the expulsion of religious orders; the closing of convents, Catholic schools and libraries; the seizure and sale of churches and religious properties; and the inability of the church to fill vacant dioceses. In 1851, Pius IX concluded a concordat with Queen Isabella II stipulating that unsold ecclesial properties were to be returned, while the church renounced properties that had already passed to new owners. This flexibility of Pius led to Spain guaranteeing the freedom of the church in religious education.']"

Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman\\'s advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars.

He also describes a conversation with Braddock in which he explicitly warned the General that his plan to march troops to the fort through a narrow valley would be dangerous because of the possibility of an ambush.  This is sometimes cited as advice against the disastrous eventual outcome, but the fact remains that Braddock was not ambushed in that final action, and the battle site was not, in any case, a narrow valley.

The expedition, named after its commander General Edward Braddock, was defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 and forced to retreat; Braddock was killed in action along with more than 500 of his troops. It ultimately proved to be a major setback for the British in the early stages of the war, one of the most disastrous defeats suffered by British forces in the 18th century.\", \"Braddock Expedition Braddock's expedition was part of a massive British offensive against the French in North America that summer. As commander-in-chief of the British Army in America, General Edward Braddock led the main thrust against the Ohio Country with a column some 2,100 strong. His command consisted of two regular line regiments, the 44th and 48th, in all 1,400 regular soldiers and 700 provincial troops from several of the Thirteen Colonies, and artillery and other support troops. With these men, Braddock expected to seize Fort Duquesne easily, and then push on to capture a series of French forts, eventually reaching Fort Niagara. George Washington, promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of the Virginia Regiment on June 4, 1754, by Governor Robert Dinwiddie, was then just 23, knew the territory and served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General Braddock. Braddock's Chief of Scouts was Lieutenant John Fraser of the Virginia Regiment.

He is remembered for his command of a disastrous expedition against the French-occupied Ohio River Valley in 1755 which led to his death.\", \"Braddock Expedition After an exchange of fire, Gage's advance group fell back. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with the main body of Braddock's force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militiamen and Native Americans enveloped them and began firing from the dense woods on both sides. At this time, the French marines began advancing from the road and blocked any attempt by the British to move forward.\", \"Edward Braddock Braddock's troops reacted poorly and became disordered. The British attempted retreat, but ran into the rest of the British soldiers earlier left behind. Braddock rallied his men repeatedly, but fell at last, mortally wounded by a shot through the chest. Although the exact causes of the defeat are debated to this day, a contributing factor was likely Braddock's underestimation of how effectively the French and Indians could react in a battle situation, and how rapidly the discipline and fighting effectiveness of his own men could evaporate.\"]"

The papacy, however, also implies the notion of primacy: that the See of Rome is preeminent among all the other Sees, and the Pope primus inter pares The origins of such a concept are historically obscure; theologically, it is based on three ancient Christian traditions: (1) that the apostle Peter was preeminent among the apostles (see Primacy of Simon Peter), (2) that it was Peter who ordained his own successors at the See of Rome, and (3) that the bishops are the successors of the apostles (see apostolic succession). While the Papal See was also the capital of the Western Empire, the prestige of the Bishop of Rome could be taken for granted without the need for sophisticated theological argumentation beyond these points; however, after the capital became Milan and then Ravenna, more detailed arguments based on Matthew 16:18–19, etc. were developed.[37] However, in antiquity, petrine and apostolic quality, as well as a \"primacy of respect\", with regard to the See of Rome were not questioned by emperors, eastern patriarchs and the Eastern Church alike.[38] The Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 affirmed the primacy of Rome.[39] While the pope\\'s appellate jurisdiction and the position of Constantinople would need further doctrinal clarification, by the end of Antiquity the primacy of Rome and the sophisticated theological arguments in its support were fully developed.

France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue (though the absence of that threat caused many colonists to conclude they no longer needed British protection). Britain also had ample places from which to obtain sugar.

On the other hand, the American conflict was known by British, British and English-speaking Canadian settlers as a Franco-Indian war.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was designed to refocus colonial expansion north into Nova Scotia and south into Florida, with the Mississippi River as the dividing line between British and Spanish possessions in America. Settlement was tightly restricted beyond the 1763 limits, and claims west of this line, including by Virginia and Massachusetts, were rescinded. With the exception of Virginia and others deprived of rights to western lands, the colonial legislatures agreed on the boundaries but disagreed on where to set them.

In her Michel de Montaigne biography (2014), Elizabeth Guild concurred with this chronology as well, except for dating the Seventh War of Religion to 1579–1580 rather than just 1580. Holt (2005) asserted a rather different periodisation from 1562 to 1629, writing of \\'civil wars\\' rather than wars of religion, dating the Sixth War to March–September 1577, and dating the Eight War from June 1584 (death of Anjou) to April 1598 (Edict of Nantes); finally, although he didn\\'t put a number on it, Holt regarded the 1610–1629 period as \\'the last war of religion\\'.', 'World War I Before World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War.

         "[\"Andrew Jackson Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the seventh president of the United States from 1829 to 1837. Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native Americans. His political philosophy became the basis for the Democratic Party.\", 'Stonewall Jackson Jackson\\'s sometimes unusual command style and personality traits, combined with his frequent success in battle, contribute to his legacy as one of the greatest generals of the Civil War. He was martial and stern in attitude and profoundly religious, a deacon in the Presbyterian Church. One of his many nicknames was \"Old Blue Lights\", a term applied to a military man whose evangelical zeal burned with the intensity of the blue light used for night-time display.', 'Andrew Jackson In 1801, Jackson was named a colonel in the Tennessee militia, a place that became his political base as well as his military base. He owned hundreds of slaves working on his estate known as \"Hermitage Plantation.\" In 1806 he killed a man in a duel on a matter of honor involving his wife Rachel. He came to have national fame through his role in the Anglo-American war of 1812, when he won a major victory against a British invasion of the Battle of New Orleans even though the Treaty of Ghent had already been signed, something unknown to all those involved in the battle.[2] In response to the conflict with the Seminole people in Spanish Florida, he invaded the territory in 1818. This was the direct cause of the first seminal war and the Treaty of Adams-Onís of 1819, which transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.', 'Andrew Jackson Jackson\\'s service in the 1812 war against British forces is known for its success and courage When the British armed forces headed for New Orleans, Jackson took command of the defenses, including militias from several Western states and territories. He was a strict commander but enjoyed popularity among his troops. They said it was just as strong as walnut wood when it was on the battlefield, so it got the nickname \"Old Hickory\" (Old Walnut) At the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, the 5,000 men of Jackson\\'s troops defeated the 7000 British soldiers At the end of the battle, the English had 2037 war victims: 291 dead (including 3 high-ranking generals), 1262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing The Americans had 71 war victims: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.[24]', 'Andrew Jackson Jackson arrived in Washington, D.C., on February 11, and began forming his cabinet. He chose Van Buren as Secretary of State, John Eaton as Secretary of War, Samuel D. Ingham as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien as Attorney General, and William T. Barry as Postmaster General. Jackson was inaugurated on March 4, 1829; Adams, who was embittered by his defeat, refused to attend. Jackson was the first president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.  In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans. Jackson invited the public to the White House, which was promptly overrun by well-wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings. The spectacle earned him the nickname \"King Mob\".', \"Andrew Jackson In 1802, he also became major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position that was determined by a vote of the militia's officers. The vote was tied between Jackson and Sevier, a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, but the governor, Archibald Roane, broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson later accused Sevier of fraud and bribery. Sevier responded by impugning Rachel's honor, resulting in a shootout on a public street. Soon afterwards, they met to duel, but parted without having fired at each other.\", 'Andrew Jackson Jackson immediately offered to raise volunteers for the war, but he was not called to duty until after the United States military was repeatedly defeated in the American Northwest. After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness.', \"Andrew Jackson On June 8, Jackson was appointed a brigadier general in the United States Army, and 10 days later was made a brevet major general with command of the Seventh Military District, which included Tennessee, Louisiana, the Mississippi Territory, and the Muscogee Creek Confederacy. With President James Madison's approval, Jackson imposed the Treaty of Fort Jackson. The treaty required all Creek, including those who had remained allies, to surrender 23,000,000 acres (9,300,000 ha) of land to the United States.\", \"Andrew Jackson Jackson's legacy has been variously used by later presidents. Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution. Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights. The members of the Progressive Party of 1948 to 1955 saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson. Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man, praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff. In 2016, Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman. Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's first presidency, Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021.\", \"Andrew Jackson Since James Madison's presidency when Jackson served as war commander, Jackson deployed a hostile attitude against the Indians, in part by ignoring president's mandates to protect the Indian lands of American settlers Madison, who displayed a paternalistic attitude toward the Indians, then joined with the tribes and commended them for leaving their hunter lives and for beginning to be farmers and farmers.[50] [51] Although there are few details, it is known that he joined with the tribes of the south-east and west, which included the Creeks and the Osage. In contrast, Jackson urged the president to ignore Indian pleas In the eight years of his term, Jackson formulated 70 treaties with the Indians in the south and the northwest.[52] Jackson's presidency marked a new era in American politics and Anglo-Indian relations of displacement of native peoples.[53] Jackson himself participated in the bargaining boards with the Indian tribes, although on other occasions he also delegated this assignment to other people. The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminola and Cherokee The northwestern tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa and the Potawatomi Although conflicts between whites and Indians took place anywhere, the problem had worsened in the south where Indian populations were larger. Clashes often took place with native tribes, especially the Creek and Seminola tribes who refused to follow treaties made by their tribes for various reasons.[54] The Second Seminole War began in December 1835, lasted six years, and finally ended under the presidency of John Tyler in August 1842.[54]\"]"

The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.', 'Pedro II of Brazil During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper, and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women\\'s rights. On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.', \"Atlantic slave trade The life expectancy for Brazil's slave plantation's for African descended slaves was around 23 years. The trans-Atlantic slave trade into Brazil was outlawed in 1831. To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro.\", \"Declaración de los Derechos del Hombre y del Ciudadano The deplorable conditions for the thousands of slaves in Saint-Domingue, the world's most profitable slave colony, led to uprisings that would be known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World Colorless people were part of the first wave of revolts, but then the former slaves took control In 1794, the Jacobin-dominated Convention abolished slavery, even in the colonies of Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe. However, Napoleon restored him in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending thousands of troops After suffering the losses of two thirds of the men, many due to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803 Napoleon renounced North America and accepted Louisiana's U.S. Purchase In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it an independent state, the Republic of Haiti, the second republic of the New World.\", 'Pedro II de Brasil His mortal remains, as well as those of his wife, were finally taken to Brazil in 1921, in time for the centenary of Brazilian independence in 1922, as the government wanted to give Peter II honors as head of state.[428] [429] The national holiday was declared and the return of the emperor as national hero was celebrated throughout the country.[424] Thousands of people participated in the main ceremony in Rio de Janeiro Historian Pedro Calmon described the scene: «The old ones wept Many were kneeling They all applauded. There were no differences between Republicans and monarchists They were all Brazilians.\"[430] This tribute marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.[429]', 'Pedro II de Brasil The diplomatic victory over the British Empire and the military victory over Uruguay in 1865, together with the happy end of the war with Paraguay in 1870, marked the beginning of what was called the \"golden age\" and heyday of the Brazilian Empire.[268] The 1870s were happy years in Brazil and the Emperor\\'s popularity was at its peak. The country made progress in the social and political spheres and all layers of society benefited from reforms and the sharing of growing prosperity.[269] Brazil\\'s international reputation, both for its political stability and for its investment potential, increased considerably and the empire was considered a modern nation.[268] The economy experienced rapid growth and immigration was expanding. New railway lines, new means of transport were built and other inventions such as telephone and postal mail were extended. \"With slavery destined to disappear and other reforms under way, the prospects for \"moral and material progress\" seemed immense.\"[270]', 'Pedro II de Brasil In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer dared to say it openly. Peter II was one of those few[271] [272] and considered slavery as a \"national shame.\"[273] Moreover, the emperor had no slaves.[271] In 1823, slaves were 29% of the Brazilian population, but this percentage was 15.2% in 1872.[274] However, the abolition of slavery was a sensitive issue in Brazil. Almost everyone, from the richest to the poorest, had their slaves.[275] [276] However, the emperor wanted to end slavery progressively[242] [277] to mitigate the impact of abolition on the national economy.[278] He pretended to ignore the increasing damage that would cause his image and that of the monarchy his support for abolition.[279]', 'Afrikáner The decades following the first Boer War were the scene of a great economic, demographic and cultural boom in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, especially after the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand This mountain range, so poetically named,[16] was the scene of a gold rush comparable to that of 1848 in California or 1851 in Victoria, Australia. Johannesburg, which had until then been a simple village, became the economic center of South Africa The capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, was filled with precious Victorian buildings and a multitude of families enriched with the new economic boom sent their children to study in the Netherlands, resulting in the emergence of a new refined and educated Afrikaner bourgeoisie.', 'Colonia del Cabo Mabin, Alan (1983) Recession and its aftermath: The Cape Colony in the Eighteen Eighties University of the Witwatersrand, African Studies Institute.']"

         "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03).

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

         "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), a liver enriched enzyme, is responsible for approximately one third of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice.

We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis.

         "Schizophrenia is recognized as a disorder of the brain and neuronal connectivity. The neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) gene plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal connectivity. We conducted a two-stage association analysis on 17 NCAM1 SNPs in two independent Han Chinese schizophrenia case-control cohorts (discovery sample from Hunan Province: 986 patients and 1040 normal controls; replication sample from Yunnan Province: 564 cases and 547 healthy controls). Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between case and control samples. Transcription factor binding site prediction and luciferase reporter assays were employed to assess the potential function of promoter SNPs. We detected developmental changes at the transcriptional level of NCAM1 during neuron differentiation in Macaca mulatta neural progenitor cells (NPC). Serum levels of NCAM1 were measured in 72 cases and 88 controls. A promoter variant, rs2301228, was found to be associated with schizophrenia at the allelic level and was validated in a replication cohort. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that risk allele rs2301228-A significantly down-regulated NCAM1 gene transcription compared to the G-allele. Concordantly, schizophrenia patients had a significantly lower level of serum NCAM1 compared to healthy donors.

         "Schizophrenia is recognized as a disorder of the brain and neuronal connectivity. The neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) gene plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal connectivity. We conducted a two-stage association analysis on 17 NCAM1 SNPs in two independent Han Chinese schizophrenia case-control cohorts (discovery sample from Hunan Province: 986 patients and 1040 normal controls; replication sample from Yunnan Province: 564 cases and 547 healthy controls). Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between case and control samples. Transcription factor binding site prediction and luciferase reporter assays were employed to assess the potential function of promoter SNPs. We detected developmental changes at the transcriptional level of NCAM1 during neuron differentiation in Macaca mulatta neural progenitor cells (NPC). Serum levels of NCAM1 were measured in 72 cases and 88 controls. A promoter variant, rs2301228, was found to be associated with schizophrenia at the allelic level and was validated in a replication cohort. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that risk allele rs2301228-A significantly down-regulated NCAM1 gene transcription compared to the G-allele. Concordantly, schizophrenia patients had a significantly lower level of serum NCAM1 compared to healthy donors.

Autorefraction and manifest refraction were performed on all eyes. The monocular through-focus acuity curve was plotted in reference to the best-corrected visual acuity by spectacle plane defocus ranging from +5.00 to -5.00 dioptres in 0.50 dioptre increments. These measurements were obtained on KPro-implanted eyes, pseudophakic eyes as controls, and on the same control eyes after fixing the pupil diameter to 3 and 2 mm using black painted iris contact lenses. Ten KPro eyes and five control eyes were included. Good agreement was noted between the subjective refractions and autorefraction in KPro eyes.

         "In most cells, the cilium is formed within a compartment separated from the cytoplasm. Entry into the ciliary compartment is regulated by a specialized gate located at the base of the cilium in a region known as the transition zone. The transition zone is closely associated with multiple structures of the ciliary base, including the centriole, axoneme, and ciliary membrane. However, the contribution of these structures to the ciliary gate remains unclear. Here we report that, in Drosophila spermatids, a conserved module of transition zone proteins mutated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), including Cep290, Mks1, B9d1, and B9d2, comprise a ciliary gate that continuously migrates away from the centriole to compartmentalize the growing axoneme tip. We show that Cep290 is essential for transition zone composition, compartmentalization of the axoneme tip, and axoneme integrity and find that MKS proteins also delimit a centriole-independent compartment in mouse spermatids.",
         "In most cells, the cilium is formed within a compartment separated from the cytoplasm. Entry into the ciliary compartment is regulated by a specialized gate located at the base of the cilium in a region known as the transition zone. The transition zone is closely associated with multiple structures of the ciliary base, including the centriole, axoneme, and ciliary membrane. However, the contribution of these structures to the ciliary gate remains unclear.

         "Active commuters have lower risk of chronic disease. Understanding which of the, to some extent, modifiable characteristics of public transportation that facilitate its use is thus important in a public health perspective. The aim of the study was to examine the association between individual public transportation accessibility and self-reported active commuting, and whether the associations varied with commute distance, age, and gender. Twenty-eight thousand nine hundred twenty-eight commuters in The Capital Region of Denmark reported self-reported time spent either walking or cycling to work or study each day and the distance to work or study. Data were obtained from the Danish National Health Survey collected in February to April 2010. Individual accessibility by public transportation was calculated using a multi-modal network in a GIS. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the association between accessibility, expressed as access area, and being an active commuter. Public transport accessibility area based on all stops within walking and cycling distance was positively associated with being an active commuter. Distance to work, age, and gender modified the associations. Residing within 10 km commute distance and in areas of high accessibility was associated with being an active commuter and meeting the recommendations of physical activity. For the respondents above 29 years, individual public transportation accessibility was positively associated with being an active commuter. Women having high accessibility had significantly higher odds of being an active commuter compared to having a low accessibility. For men, the associations were insignificant.",

All samples were stained with smooth muscle actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of smooth muscle fibers of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic smooth muscle fibers. Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64%).

Our main goal was to evaluate the role of total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression in cases of clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer progression. Total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 134 clinically high grade T1 tumors. We assessed clinical progression to muscle invasive disease or radical cystectomy as a patient outcome end point. Survival analysis was done for recurrence-free, progression-free, disease specific and overall survival. A total of 132 patients (98.5%) underwent repeat transurethral resection. Cases of early progression (less than 3 months) were excluded from study to avoid under staging. Of the tumors 90 (67.2%) showed ΔNp63 expression loss. During a median followup of 62.1 months 19 patients (14.2%) progressed to muscle invasive disease. The progression rate was 21.1% in patients with tumors characterized by ΔNp63 loss but no progression was observed in those with tumors with ΔNp63 expression (p <0.001).

This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence.

DXS significantly increased crossing grid numbers, sucrose consumption, and body weight. This treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, DXS elicited no significant effects on IL-1β, IL-2, and interferon γ. DXS downregulated the activity of IDO and subsequent production of Kyn in the hippocampus.

DXS significantly increased crossing grid numbers, sucrose consumption, and body weight. This treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, DXS elicited no significant effects on IL-1β, IL-2, and interferon γ. DXS downregulated the activity of IDO and subsequent production of Kyn in the hippocampus. This treatment upregulated the hippocampal contents of Trp and 5-HT but did not influence 5-HT turnover.",

The longitudinal links among insomnia, depression and work incapacity are poorly known. We examined association of self-reported sleep quality with incident symptoms of depression and disability retirement due to depressive disorders in a longitudinal population-based sample of twins (n=12,063 individuals). These adults were categorized by their sleep quality in 1975 and 1981, excluding individuals with depressed mood in 1975/1981. The outcomes were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDItot) and its subscale Negative Attitudes Towards Self (BDINATS) in 1990 as dichotomized measures, and the incidence of disability retirement due to depressive disorder during 1991-2004. Onset of poor sleep between 1975 and 1981 predicted incident depression (BDItot OR=4.5, 95% CI: 2.7-7.4, BDINATS OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-2.7), while persistent poor sleep showed somewhat weaker effects (BDItot; OR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.0-6.0, BDINATS OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.3). Among those with few recent stressful life events, onset of poor sleep predicted strongly depression (BDINATS OR=9.5, 95% CI: 3.7-24.2).

The effects of VEGFR1/2 kinase inhibitor (VRI) and calycosin on Flt1 tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were evaluated by molecular docking, enzymatic inhibition assay, protein co-immunoprecipitation and siRNA gene knock-down analysis in HUVECs. Toxicities of the chemicals were examined using HUVECs viability. Their effects on angiogenesis and vessel formation were furthered studied in HUVECs in vitro and Tg(fli-1:EGFP) zebrafish in vivo. The gene and protein expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. VRI strongly inhibited physiological functions of both VEGF receptors and suppressed endothelial cell survival. This resulted in blood vessel loss in zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, calycosin co-treatment impeded VRI-induced blood vessel loss. Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs. Further studies in vitro and in vivo showed that the minimizing effect of calycosin on VRI-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity was blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor).

         "Normal aging is associated with a decline in cognitive abilities, particularly in the domains of psychomotor speed and executive functioning. However, 'aging,' per se, is not a cause of cognitive decline but rather a variable that likely captures multiple accumulating biological changes over time that collectively affect mental abilities. Recent work has focused on the role of cerebrovascular disease as one of the biological changes. In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan. Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds. The two groups were similar in age at scan date, education, ethnicity, sex distribution, and cognitive performance at first visit.",

Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan. Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds. The two groups were similar in age at scan date, education, ethnicity, sex distribution, and cognitive performance at first visit.",

         "In recent years, the relationship between physical activity (PA) and smoking cessation has been increasingly studied. However, very few studies have investigated the possible protective role of PA on smoking relapse on the long term. This study evaluated the impact of self-reported PA in precessation on smoking relapse. Other variables evaluated included measures of dependence, socio-demographic factors and smoking-related variables. Several possible interactions between PA and well identified factors influencing smoking relapse rate were also explored. After the initial consultation, 345 smokers were consecutively recruited in a smoking-cessation unit. Smoking abstinence was collected regularly during consultation or by phone calls. PA was measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to determine factors associated with smoking relapse. Among the initial sample, 227 adults were included in the survival analysis. After adjustment for potential cofounders, PA was not associated with smoking relapse. Self-efficacy level, absence of professional activity, previous attempts to quit and alcohol use disorders were associated with relapse. Secondary analysis showed a statistically significant effect of an interaction term for PA and antidepressant use on reducing smoking relapse (HR = .81, 95% CI: .66-.99).",

The clinical diagnosis of neurovascular events, specifically transient ischemic attack can be challenging, although there is disagreement among vascular trained neurologists regarding this. Currently, there is no single accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia. We studied the relationship between Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels and the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia in the acute phase among patients evaluated in the emergency department following transient focal neurological symptoms. Patients evaluated in our academic center for transient neurological symptoms of possible ischemic mechanism were enrolled with informed consent. Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were performed by DiaDexus, Inc. 100 patients were enrolled: 58 were ischemic (30 stroke, 28 TIA), 10 were unknown, and 28 were non-ischemic. Blood samples were collected after a median delay of 23 h (IQR: 17, 36) after symptom onset. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 activity level for ischemic (stroke and TIA) versus non-ischemic events were 186.5 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 153, 216.3) and 169 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 137, 212.5), respectively. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 mass level for ischemic versus non-ischemic events were 202 ng/ml (IQR = 171.6, 226.1) and 192 ng/ml (167.8, 230). The differences in median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were not statistically significant in the ischemic versus non-ischemic patients. Vessel imaging revealed a symptomatic stenosis in 14 patients (10 intracranial and 4 cervical). The median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels among patients with a symptomatic stenosis were not significantly higher than the levels measured in TIA/stroke patients without stenosis.",

         "Recently, the role of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the pathogenesis of heart failure through different mechanisms has received much attention. Subclinical changes in left ventricular (LV) function can be identified using quantification of myocardial strain, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a superior predictor of outcomes than ejection fraction. We hypothesized that increased OPG levels could predict subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in treated diabetic hypertensive patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. The study was composed of 86 diabetic hypertensive and 30 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. All patients underwent echocardiography and venous blood samples were taken for determination of OPG. The relation between OPG levels and LV GLS was investigated using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Diabetic hypertensive patients had higher diastolic peak early/early diastolic tissue velocity and lower systolic tissue velocity, GLS, GLS rate systolic, and GLS rate early diastolic than nondiabetic hypertensive patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.049, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively). Diabetic hypertensive patients were divided into 2 groups according to median GLS value (> 18.5 and ≤ 18.5). The patients with GLS ≤ 18.5 had higher diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; P = 0.048), OPG (pmol/L; P < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (%; P = 0.042) values than those with GLS > 18.5. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, OPG was found to be an independent predictor of impaired GLS (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that OPG values of > 6.45 (pmol/L) identified the patients with GLS ≤ 18.5.",

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

Candidates were examined in an investigation cohort (n = 110) using pyrosequencing and genotyping for putative methylation-associated polymorphisms performed using standard PCR. Array analysis identified 314 candidate genes associated with BWC extremes, four of which showed ≥ 4 BWC-linked CpGs. Of these, PM20D1 and MI886 suggested genetically determined methylation levels. However, methylation at three CpGs in FGFR2 remained significantly associated with high BWC (p = 0.004-0.027).",

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

We used IL-13-transformed, highly enriched goblet cells and differentiated (ciliary cell-enriched) human bronchial epithelial cell culture to evaluate the relative contribution of ciliated and goblet cells to airway sPLA2 generation and response. We wished to determine the primary source(s) of sPLA2 and leukotrienes in human airway epithelial cells. Human bronchial epithelial cells from subjects without lung disease were differentiated to a ciliated-enriched or goblet-enriched cell phenotype. Synthesis of sPLA2, cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), and airway mucin messenger RNA and protein was measured by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the localization of mucin and sPLA2 to specific cells types was confirmed by confocal microscopy. sPLA2 group IIa, V, and X messenger RNA expression was increased in ciliated-enriched cells (P < .001) but not in goblet-enriched cells. sPLA2 were secreted from the apical (air) side of ciliated-enriched cells but not goblet-enriched cells (P < .001). Immunostaining of sPLA2 V was strongly positive in ciliated-enriched cells but not in goblet-enriched cells. sPLA2 released cysLTs from goblet-enriched cells but not from ciliated-enriched cells, and this result was greatest with sPLA2 V (P < .05). sPLA2 V increased goblet-enriched cell mucin secretion, which was inhibited by inhibitors of lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase (P < .02).",

However, data regarding the relationship between hyperglycemia and the success of FT are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of admission blood glucose for the prediction of failed reperfusion following FT. This is a retrospective study of 304 STEMI patients who received FT and whose admission glucose levels were recorded. The main outcome measure was ST segment resolution≥50%. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) blood glucose level in the entire study group was 112 (95-153). In 92 (30.2%) patients, FT was unsuccessful and rescue PCI was performed.

The neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) gene plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal connectivity. We conducted a two-stage association analysis on 17 NCAM1 SNPs in two independent Han Chinese schizophrenia case-control cohorts (discovery sample from Hunan Province: 986 patients and 1040 normal controls; replication sample from Yunnan Province: 564 cases and 547 healthy controls). Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between case and control samples. Transcription factor binding site prediction and luciferase reporter assays were employed to assess the potential function of promoter SNPs. We detected developmental changes at the transcriptional level of NCAM1 during neuron differentiation in Macaca mulatta neural progenitor cells (NPC). Serum levels of NCAM1 were measured in 72 cases and 88 controls. A promoter variant, rs2301228, was found to be associated with schizophrenia at the allelic level and was validated in a replication cohort. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that risk allele rs2301228-A significantly down-regulated NCAM1 gene transcription compared to the G-allele. Concordantly, schizophrenia patients had a significantly lower level of serum NCAM1 compared to healthy donors. During the NPC neuronal differentiation, NCAM1 mRNA was significantly increased, suggesting a critical role of this gene in neural development.",

Entry into the ciliary compartment is regulated by a specialized gate located at the base of the cilium in a region known as the transition zone. The transition zone is closely associated with multiple structures of the ciliary base, including the centriole, axoneme, and ciliary membrane. However, the contribution of these structures to the ciliary gate remains unclear. Here we report that, in Drosophila spermatids, a conserved module of transition zone proteins mutated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), including Cep290, Mks1, B9d1, and B9d2, comprise a ciliary gate that continuously migrates away from the centriole to compartmentalize the growing axoneme tip. We show that Cep290 is essential for transition zone composition, compartmentalization of the axoneme tip, and axoneme integrity and find that MKS proteins also delimit a centriole-independent compartment in mouse spermatids.",

Understanding which of the, to some extent, modifiable characteristics of public transportation that facilitate its use is thus important in a public health perspective. The aim of the study was to examine the association between individual public transportation accessibility and self-reported active commuting, and whether the associations varied with commute distance, age, and gender. Twenty-eight thousand nine hundred twenty-eight commuters in The Capital Region of Denmark reported self-reported time spent either walking or cycling to work or study each day and the distance to work or study. Data were obtained from the Danish National Health Survey collected in February to April 2010. Individual accessibility by public transportation was calculated using a multi-modal network in a GIS. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the association between accessibility, expressed as access area, and being an active commuter. Public transport accessibility area based on all stops within walking and cycling distance was positively associated with being an active commuter. Distance to work, age, and gender modified the associations. Residing within 10 km commute distance and in areas of high accessibility was associated with being an active commuter and meeting the recommendations of physical activity. For the respondents above 29 years, individual public transportation accessibility was positively associated with being an active commuter. Women having high accessibility had significantly higher odds of being an active commuter compared to having a low accessibility. For men, the associations were insignificant.",

Resection of dartos tissue usually makes the penis straight in patients with hypospadias and corrects it in those with buried penis, suggesting a common pathophysiology related to dartos tissue. Tissue samples from 113 children undergoing primary penile surgery for hypospadias (94 patients), epispadias (1) or buried penis (18) were collected between November 2011 and September 2013. Tissue samples from 79 children undergoing circumcision for nonmedical reasons served as controls. All samples were stained with smooth muscle actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of smooth muscle fibers of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic smooth muscle fibers. Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64%). Of buried penis cases 78% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 4 cases and III in 10, p = 0.001). Of hypospadias cases 70% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 31 cases, III in 32, and mixed II and III in 3, p < 0.001). The only epispadias case was designated pattern II.",

However, these factors are not specific enough to define which patients should be treated immediately with radical cystectomy. Therefore, it is critical to identify molecular markers that can help provide individualized, risk stratified decision making. Our main goal was to evaluate the role of total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression in cases of clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer progression. Total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 134 clinically high grade T1 tumors. We assessed clinical progression to muscle invasive disease or radical cystectomy as a patient outcome end point. Survival analysis was done for recurrence-free, progression-free, disease specific and overall survival. A total of 132 patients (98.5%) underwent repeat transurethral resection. Cases of early progression (less than 3 months) were excluded from study to avoid under staging. Of the tumors 90 (67.2%) showed ΔNp63 expression loss. During a median followup of 62.1 months 19 patients (14.2%) progressed to muscle invasive disease. The progression rate was 21.1% in patients with tumors characterized by ΔNp63 loss but no progression was observed in those with tumors with ΔNp63 expression (p <0.001).

We have shown that stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin type-B receptor 4 (Eph-B4) with its ligand ephrin-B2 prevents neointimal hyperplasia in murine vein grafts. This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence. The baseline intima/media ratio in saphenous vein rings was 0.456 ± 0.097, which increased to 0.726 ± 0.142 in untreated veins after 14 days in organ culture but only to 0.630 ± 0.132 in veins treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (n = 19, P = .017). Ephrin-B2/Fc stimulated Akt, endothelial NO synthase and caveolin-1 phosphorylation, and NO release (P = .007) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (n = 6).

Subsequently, the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) identified risk loci for BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma near CRTC1 and BARX1, and within 100 kb of FOXP1. We aimed to identify further SNPs that increased BE risk and to validate previously reported associations. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify variants associated with BE and further analyzed promising variants identified by BEACON by genotyping 10,158 patients with BE and 21,062 controls.

Chemical fingerprints of gardenoside, paeoniflorin, ferulic acid, paeonol, and ligustilide in standard extraction were used as the material bases of DXS. Rats with depressive-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) were randomly divided into four groups, namely the control, model, DXS, and fluoxetine groups. Cytokines, IDO, and tryptophan (Trp) catabolites were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. DXS significantly increased crossing grid numbers, sucrose consumption, and body weight. This treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, DXS elicited no significant effects on IL-1β, IL-2, and interferon γ. DXS downregulated the activity of IDO and subsequent production of Kyn in the hippocampus.

         "title Chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis (CARP) occurs more frequently in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with concomitant autoimmune disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the overlap between dysregulated immune features in patients with IPAA and their association with CARP. We identified 150 symptomatic patients with IPAA who met inclusion criteria, including measurement of select autoimmune serology. Demographic and clinical variables were compared between patients with and without CARP. Autoimmune thyroid disease was more frequent among patients with CARP. The frequency of primary sclerosing cholangitis (16.7% versus 5.3%; P = 0.04) and serum positivity for microsomal antibody (25% versus 6.1%, P = 0.003) were significantly greater in patients with CARP compared with non-CARP patients, respectively. Increased tissue infiltration by IgG4-expressing plasma cells was detected in 17 of 31 patients (54.8%) in the CARP group as compared with 10/67 (14.9%) in the non-CARP group (P = 0.0001). Forty-seven percent of patients in the CARP group versus 22.8% in the non-CARP group had at least 2 immune features (P = 0.019). Among patients with IgG4 histology, 87% of patients in the CARP group versus 60% in the non-CARP group had at least 1 immune marker (P = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, microsomal antibody expression (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-42.6; P = 0.02) and increased IgG4-expressing plasma cells tissue infiltration (odds ratio, 9.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-32.6, P = 0.0001) were risk factors for CARP.",

         "title The principal oxidative-stress defense in the human parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the tryparedoxin-dependent peroxide detoxification pathway, constituted by trypanothione reductase (TryR), tryparedoxin (TXN), tryparedoxin peroxidase (TXNPx) and tryparedoxin-dependent glutathione peroxidase A (GPxA). Here, Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) was applied to quantitatively prioritize drug target(s) within the pathway by identifying its flux-controlling enzymes. The recombinant enzymes were kinetically characterized at physiological pH/temperature. Further, the pathway was in vitro reconstituted using enzyme activity ratios and fluxes similar to those observed in the parasites; then, enzyme and substrate titrations were performed to determine their degree of control on flux. Also, kinetic characterization of the whole pathway was performed. Analyses of the kinetic properties indicated that TXN is the less efficient pathway enzyme derived from its high Kmapp for trypanothione and low Vmax values within the cell. MCA established that the TXN-TXNPx and TXN-GPxA redox pairs controlled by 90-100% the pathway flux, whereas 10% control was attained by TryR. The Kmapp values of the complete pathway for substrates suggested that the pathway flux was determined by the peroxide availability, whereas at high peroxide concentrations, flux may be limited by NADPH.",

         "title The role of Kdr (VEGFR-2/Flk-1) in vascular formation has been well described, but the role of Flt1 (VEGFR-1) is not well studied and is generally considered as a decoy receptor for trapping VEGF. The effects of VEGFR1/2 kinase inhibitor (VRI) and calycosin on Flt1 tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were evaluated by molecular docking, enzymatic inhibition assay, protein co-immunoprecipitation and siRNA gene knock-down analysis in HUVECs. Toxicities of the chemicals were examined using HUVECs viability. Their effects on angiogenesis and vessel formation were furthered studied in HUVECs in vitro and Tg(fli-1:EGFP) zebrafish in vivo. The gene and protein expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. VRI strongly inhibited physiological functions of both VEGF receptors and suppressed endothelial cell survival. This resulted in blood vessel loss in zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, calycosin co-treatment impeded VRI-induced blood vessel loss. Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs. Further studies in vitro and in vivo showed that the minimizing effect of calycosin on VRI-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity was blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor). The impeding effect of calycosin on VRI-induced blood vessel loss was absent in zebrafish embryos injected with Flt1 MO.",

A TLR7/8 agonist, CL097, was conjugated with alum-absorbed HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), as confirmed by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF MS). Mice from two independently generated HBV-transgenic (HBV-Tg) colonies, C57BL/6J-TgN (AlblHBV) 44Bri/J mice and C57BL/6-HBV-1.3 genome-eq mice, were immunized with CL097-conjugated HBV-Ag every 2 weeks, four times.

         "title Normal aging is associated with a decline in cognitive abilities, particularly in the domains of psychomotor speed and executive functioning. However, 'aging,' per se, is not a cause of cognitive decline but rather a variable that likely captures multiple accumulating biological changes over time that collectively affect mental abilities. Recent work has focused on the role of cerebrovascular disease as one of the biological changes. In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan. Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds. The two groups were similar in age at scan date, education, ethnicity, sex distribution, and cognitive performance at first visit.",

However, very few studies have investigated the possible protective role of PA on smoking relapse on the long term. This study evaluated the impact of self-reported PA in precessation on smoking relapse. Other variables evaluated included measures of dependence, socio-demographic factors and smoking-related variables. Several possible interactions between PA and well identified factors influencing smoking relapse rate were also explored. After the initial consultation, 345 smokers were consecutively recruited in a smoking-cessation unit. Smoking abstinence was collected regularly during consultation or by phone calls. PA was measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to determine factors associated with smoking relapse. Among the initial sample, 227 adults were included in the survival analysis. After adjustment for potential cofounders, PA was not associated with smoking relapse. Self-efficacy level, absence of professional activity, previous attempts to quit and alcohol use disorders were associated with relapse. Secondary analysis showed a statistically significant effect of an interaction term for PA and antidepressant use on reducing smoking relapse (HR = .81, 95% CI: .66-.99).",

Vital signs were tracked for 24 h and mortality for 180 days. Of 311 patients, those who were SOBAR (42%) had higher median heart rate (HR) (100 vs. 85 b.p.m.; P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (141 vs. 122 mmHg; P < 0.001), and respiratory rate (RR) (24 vs. 18 breaths/min; P < 0.001) compared with those who were CARBOSE (56%).

The clinical diagnosis of neurovascular events, specifically transient ischemic attack can be challenging, although there is disagreement among vascular trained neurologists regarding this. Currently, there is no single accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia. We studied the relationship between Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels and the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia in the acute phase among patients evaluated in the emergency department following transient focal neurological symptoms. Patients evaluated in our academic center for transient neurological symptoms of possible ischemic mechanism were enrolled with informed consent. Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were performed by DiaDexus, Inc. 100 patients were enrolled: 58 were ischemic (30 stroke, 28 TIA), 10 were unknown, and 28 were non-ischemic. Blood samples were collected after a median delay of 23 h (IQR: 17, 36) after symptom onset. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 activity level for ischemic (stroke and TIA) versus non-ischemic events were 186.5 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 153, 216.3) and 169 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 137, 212.5), respectively. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 mass level for ischemic versus non-ischemic events were 202 ng/ml (IQR = 171.6, 226.1) and 192 ng/ml (167.8, 230). The differences in median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were not statistically significant in the ischemic versus non-ischemic patients. Vessel imaging revealed a symptomatic stenosis in 14 patients (10 intracranial and 4 cervical).

         "title Recently, the role of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the pathogenesis of heart failure through different mechanisms has received much attention. Subclinical changes in left ventricular (LV) function can be identified using quantification of myocardial strain, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a superior predictor of outcomes than ejection fraction. We hypothesized that increased OPG levels could predict subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in treated diabetic hypertensive patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. The study was composed of 86 diabetic hypertensive and 30 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. All patients underwent echocardiography and venous blood samples were taken for determination of OPG. The relation between OPG levels and LV GLS was investigated using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Diabetic hypertensive patients had higher diastolic peak early/early diastolic tissue velocity and lower systolic tissue velocity, GLS, GLS rate systolic, and GLS rate early diastolic than nondiabetic hypertensive patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.049, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively). Diabetic hypertensive patients were divided into 2 groups according to median GLS value (> 18.5 and ≤ 18.5). The patients with GLS ≤ 18.5 had higher diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; P = 0.048), OPG (pmol/L; P < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (%; P = 0.042) values than those with GLS > 18.5. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, OPG was found to be an independent predictor of impaired GLS (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that OPG values of > 6.45 (pmol/L) identified the patients with GLS ≤ 18.5.",

Plasma NT-proANP1-98 concentrations were determined using a radioimmunoassay. Thirty-three genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB locus and were all replicated. To assess the significance, in vitro functional genomic studies and clinical outcomes for carriers of a single-nucleotide polymorphism rs5063 (V32M) located in NPPA that represented the most significant variation in this genetic locus were assessed.

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

Using HumanMethylation450 arrays, we examined candidate gene-associated CpGs in cord blood from newborns with low (<15th centile), medium (40-60th centile) and high (>85th centile) BWC (n = 12). Candidates were examined in an investigation cohort (n = 110) using pyrosequencing and genotyping for putative methylation-associated polymorphisms performed using standard PCR. Array analysis identified 314 candidate genes associated with BWC extremes, four of which showed ≥ 4 BWC-linked CpGs. Of these, PM20D1 and MI886 suggested genetically determined methylation levels. However, methylation at three CpGs in FGFR2 remained significantly associated with high BWC (p = 0.004-0.027).",

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice.

Nevertheless, whether expression of Syk and TRAF6 is altered in SLE B cells remains unknown. Phosphorylation and/or expression of Syk and TRAF6 were analyzed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from SLE patients. Pronounced phosphorylation and expression of Syk were noted in B cells from SLE patients compared with healthy donors. Levels of Syk phosphorylation correlated with the disease activity score. TRAF6 was significantly over-expressed in B cells of SLE patients as compared with healthy donors, and significant correlation of levels of TRAF6 expression and Syk phosphorylation was observed in SLE patients. Levels of TRAF6 expression were more pronounced in CD27+ memory B cells than in CD27-naïve B cells. In vitro treatment of SLE B cells with a Syk inhibitor (BAY61-3606) reduced Syk phosphorylation as well as TRAF6 expression.",

These measurements were obtained on KPro-implanted eyes, pseudophakic eyes as controls, and on the same control eyes after fixing the pupil diameter to 3 and 2 mm using black painted iris contact lenses. Ten KPro eyes and five control eyes were included. Good agreement was noted between the subjective refractions and autorefraction in KPro eyes.

Twenty-eight thousand nine hundred twenty-eight commuters in The Capital Region of Denmark reported self-reported time spent either walking or cycling to work or study each day and the distance to work or study. Data were obtained from the Danish National Health Survey collected in February to April 2010. Individual accessibility by public transportation was calculated using a multi-modal network in a GIS. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the association between accessibility, expressed as access area, and being an active commuter. Public transport accessibility area based on all stops within walking and cycling distance was positively associated with being an active commuter. Distance to work, age, and gender modified the associations. Residing within 10 km commute distance and in areas of high accessibility was associated with being an active commuter and meeting the recommendations of physical activity. For the respondents above 29 years, individual public transportation accessibility was positively associated with being an active commuter. Women having high accessibility had significantly higher odds of being an active commuter compared to having a low accessibility. For men, the associations were insignificant.",

However, these factors are not specific enough to define which patients should be treated immediately with radical cystectomy. Therefore, it is critical to identify molecular markers that can help provide individualized, risk stratified decision making. Our main goal was to evaluate the role of total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression in cases of clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer progression. Total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 134 clinically high grade T1 tumors. We assessed clinical progression to muscle invasive disease or radical cystectomy as a patient outcome end point. Survival analysis was done for recurrence-free, progression-free, disease specific and overall survival. A total of 132 patients (98.5%) underwent repeat transurethral resection. Cases of early progression (less than 3 months) were excluded from study to avoid under staging. Of the tumors 90 (67.2%) showed ΔNp63 expression loss. During a median followup of 62.1 months 19 patients (14.2%) progressed to muscle invasive disease. The progression rate was 21.1% in patients with tumors characterized by ΔNp63 loss but no progression was observed in those with tumors with ΔNp63 expression (p <0.001). There was no difference in the number of patients who underwent repeat transurethral resection, had associated carcinoma in situ, showed lymphovascular invasion or received followup intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin courses.",

Chemical fingerprints of gardenoside, paeoniflorin, ferulic acid, paeonol, and ligustilide in standard extraction were used as the material bases of DXS. Rats with depressive-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) were randomly divided into four groups, namely the control, model, DXS, and fluoxetine groups. Cytokines, IDO, and tryptophan (Trp) catabolites were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. DXS significantly increased crossing grid numbers, sucrose consumption, and body weight. This treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, DXS elicited no significant effects on IL-1β, IL-2, and interferon γ. DXS downregulated the activity of IDO and subsequent production of Kyn in the hippocampus.

Rats with depressive-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) were randomly divided into four groups, namely the control, model, DXS, and fluoxetine groups. Cytokines, IDO, and tryptophan (Trp) catabolites were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. DXS significantly increased crossing grid numbers, sucrose consumption, and body weight. This treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, DXS elicited no significant effects on IL-1β, IL-2, and interferon γ. DXS downregulated the activity of IDO and subsequent production of Kyn in the hippocampus. This treatment upregulated the hippocampal contents of Trp and 5-HT but did not influence 5-HT turnover.",

However, 'aging,' per se, is not a cause of cognitive decline but rather a variable that likely captures multiple accumulating biological changes over time that collectively affect mental abilities. Recent work has focused on the role of cerebrovascular disease as one of the biological changes. In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan. Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds.

The National HF Audit for England and Wales suggests that this assumption is false, which has profound implications for management A retrospective case-note review was carried out of patients hospitalized with HF to determine how many present with shortness of breath at rest or are comfortable at rest but breathless on slight exertion (CARBOSE). Vital signs were tracked for 24 h and mortality for 180 days. Of 311 patients, those who were SOBAR (42%) had higher median heart rate (HR) (100 vs. 85 b.p.m.; P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (141 vs. 122 mmHg; P < 0.001), and respiratory rate (RR) (24 vs. 18 breaths/min; P < 0.001) compared with those who were CARBOSE (56%). Vital signs changed little in those who were CARBOSE over the first 4-6 h, but SBP (141-128 mmHg; P < 0.001), HR (100-90 b.p.m.; P = 0.002), and RR (24-20 breaths/min; P < 0.001) fell in those who were SOBAR.

However, very few studies have investigated the possible protective role of PA on smoking relapse on the long term. This study evaluated the impact of self-reported PA in precessation on smoking relapse. Other variables evaluated included measures of dependence, socio-demographic factors and smoking-related variables. Several possible interactions between PA and well identified factors influencing smoking relapse rate were also explored. After the initial consultation, 345 smokers were consecutively recruited in a smoking-cessation unit. Smoking abstinence was collected regularly during consultation or by phone calls. PA was measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to determine factors associated with smoking relapse. Among the initial sample, 227 adults were included in the survival analysis. After adjustment for potential cofounders, PA was not associated with smoking relapse. Self-efficacy level, absence of professional activity, previous attempts to quit and alcohol use disorders were associated with relapse. Secondary analysis showed a statistically significant effect of an interaction term for PA and antidepressant use on reducing smoking relapse (HR = .81, 95% CI: .66-.99).",

Subclinical changes in left ventricular (LV) function can be identified using quantification of myocardial strain, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a superior predictor of outcomes than ejection fraction. We hypothesized that increased OPG levels could predict subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in treated diabetic hypertensive patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. The study was composed of 86 diabetic hypertensive and 30 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. All patients underwent echocardiography and venous blood samples were taken for determination of OPG. The relation between OPG levels and LV GLS was investigated using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Diabetic hypertensive patients had higher diastolic peak early/early diastolic tissue velocity and lower systolic tissue velocity, GLS, GLS rate systolic, and GLS rate early diastolic than nondiabetic hypertensive patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.049, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively). Diabetic hypertensive patients were divided into 2 groups according to median GLS value (> 18.5 and ≤ 18.5). The patients with GLS ≤ 18.5 had higher diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; P = 0.048), OPG (pmol/L; P < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (%; P = 0.042) values than those with GLS > 18.5. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, OPG was found to be an independent predictor of impaired GLS (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that OPG values of > 6.45 (pmol/L) identified the patients with GLS ≤ 18.5.",

Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985.",

         "William Tecumseh Sherman Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.\"",

         "Harry S. Truman In 1950, the Senate, led by Estes Kefauver, investigated numerous corruption charges among senior administration officials, some of whom received fur coats and freezers for favors. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was involved In 1950, 166 employees of the IRS resigned or were dismissed,[175] and many faced allegations from the Department of Justice in a variety of tax fixing and bribery charges, including the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Tax Division When Attorney General Howard McGrath fired the special attorney for being too jealous, Truman fired McGrath.[176] Historians agree that Truman himself was innocent. In 1945, Truman got a new, expensive freezer, and very hard to get. The businessman who always got him gifts was the president of a perfume company and, thanks to the help of Truman and confidante general Harry Vaughan, he was given priority to fly to Europe days after the war, where he bought new perfumes On the way back to the United States, he \"knocked\" on a wounded veteran who was also returning to the country. Release of the episode in 1949 humiliated Truman The President responded strongly by defending Vaughan, an old friend with his own office in the White House Vaughan was time-related to multiple traffic scandals.[177]",

To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro.",

They later enslaved Africans brought from West and Central Africa in ships by way of the Atlantic slave trade. Brazil imported 4.8 million enslaved Africans. Africans who escaped slavery there formed quilombos, maroon communities with degrees of self-governance. Palamares, a quilombo community, lasted for 100 years while other communities were quickly removed by the Dutch and Portuguese. The Africans imported to Brazil were Yoruba, Fon, Bantu and others. Their religions from Africa developed into new world religions in Brazil called Candomblé, Umbanda, Xango, and Macumba.'",

         "Pedro II of Brazil In the 1870s, progress was made in both social and political spheres as segments of society benefited from the reforms and shared in the increasing prosperity. Brazil's international reputation for political stability and investment potential greatly improved. The Empire was seen as a modern and progressive nation unequaled, with the exception of the United States, in the Americas. The economy began growing rapidly and immigration flourished. Railroad, shipping and other modernization projects were adopted. With \"slavery destined for extinction and other reforms projected, the prospects for 'moral and material advances' seemed vast.\"",

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis.

Radical species with oxidative activity, including reactive nitrogen species, represent mediators of inflammation and cartilage damage. To assess serum nitric oxide as a marker of oxidative stress in Egyptian patients with rheumatoid arthritis and its relation to disease activity. 80 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were divided into 2 groups, according to the DAS-28 score: Group I: 42 patients with disease activity, and Group II: 38 patients with no disease activity. Forty age- and sex-matched individuals were included as control group (Group III). Routine laboratory investigations were done, and nitric oxide was measured using Elisa. Hand plain radiographies were done for radiological status scoring using the Sharp method. A comparison between nitric oxide in all three groups showed a highly significant difference (p < 0.001), significantly higher levels were obtained among rheumatoid arthritis patients in comparison to controls, and higher levels were obtained in patients with active disease (mean±SD 82.38±20.46) in comparison to patients without active disease (35.53±7.15).

Resection of dartos tissue usually makes the penis straight in patients with hypospadias and corrects it in those with buried penis, suggesting a common pathophysiology related to dartos tissue. Tissue samples from 113 children undergoing primary penile surgery for hypospadias (94 patients), epispadias (1) or buried penis (18) were collected between November 2011 and September 2013. Tissue samples from 79 children undergoing circumcision for nonmedical reasons served as controls. All samples were stained with smooth muscle actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of smooth muscle fibers of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic smooth muscle fibers. Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64%). Of buried penis cases 78% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 4 cases and III in 10, p = 0.001). Of hypospadias cases 70% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 31 cases, III in 32, and mixed II and III in 3, p < 0.001). The only epispadias case was designated pattern II.",

Our main goal was to evaluate the role of total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression in cases of clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer progression. Total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 134 clinically high grade T1 tumors. We assessed clinical progression to muscle invasive disease or radical cystectomy as a patient outcome end point. Survival analysis was done for recurrence-free, progression-free, disease specific and overall survival. A total of 132 patients (98.5%) underwent repeat transurethral resection. Cases of early progression (less than 3 months) were excluded from study to avoid under staging. Of the tumors 90 (67.2%) showed ΔNp63 expression loss. During a median followup of 62.1 months 19 patients (14.2%) progressed to muscle invasive disease.

This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence.

Onset of poor sleep between 1975 and 1981 predicted incident depression (BDItot OR=4.5, 95% CI: 2.7-7.4, BDINATS OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-2.7), while persistent poor sleep showed somewhat weaker effects (BDItot; OR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.0-6.0, BDINATS OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.3). Among those with few recent stressful life events, onset of poor sleep predicted strongly depression (BDINATS OR=9.5, 95% CI: 3.7-24.2). Likewise onset of poor sleep by 1981 increased the risk of disability retirement due to depression (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.8-4.9) with a similar risk among those with persistent poor sleep (OR=2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7).",

The effects of VEGFR1/2 kinase inhibitor (VRI) and calycosin on Flt1 tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were evaluated by molecular docking, enzymatic inhibition assay, protein co-immunoprecipitation and siRNA gene knock-down analysis in HUVECs. Toxicities of the chemicals were examined using HUVECs viability. Their effects on angiogenesis and vessel formation were furthered studied in HUVECs in vitro and Tg(fli-1:EGFP) zebrafish in vivo. The gene and protein expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. VRI strongly inhibited physiological functions of both VEGF receptors and suppressed endothelial cell survival. This resulted in blood vessel loss in zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, calycosin co-treatment impeded VRI-induced blood vessel loss. Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs. Further studies in vitro and in vivo showed that the minimizing effect of calycosin on VRI-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity was blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor). The impeding effect of calycosin on VRI-induced blood vessel loss was absent in zebrafish embryos injected with Flt1 MO.",

However, 'aging,' per se, is not a cause of cognitive decline but rather a variable that likely captures multiple accumulating biological changes over time that collectively affect mental abilities. Recent work has focused on the role of cerebrovascular disease as one of the biological changes. In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan. Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds.

The National HF Audit for England and Wales suggests that this assumption is false, which has profound implications for management A retrospective case-note review was carried out of patients hospitalized with HF to determine how many present with shortness of breath at rest or are comfortable at rest but breathless on slight exertion (CARBOSE). Vital signs were tracked for 24 h and mortality for 180 days. Of 311 patients, those who were SOBAR (42%) had higher median heart rate (HR) (100 vs. 85 b.p.m.; P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (141 vs. 122 mmHg; P < 0.001), and respiratory rate (RR) (24 vs. 18 breaths/min; P < 0.001) compared with those who were CARBOSE (56%).

         "Many assume that most patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) are short of breath at rest (SOBAR). The National HF Audit for England and Wales suggests that this assumption is false, which has profound implications for management A retrospective case-note review was carried out of patients hospitalized with HF to determine how many present with shortness of breath at rest or are comfortable at rest but breathless on slight exertion (CARBOSE). Vital signs were tracked for 24 h and mortality for 180 days. Of 311 patients, those who were SOBAR (42%) had higher median heart rate (HR) (100 vs. 85 b.p.m.; P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (141 vs. 122 mmHg; P < 0.001), and respiratory rate (RR) (24 vs. 18 breaths/min; P < 0.001) compared with those who were CARBOSE (56%). Vital signs changed little in those who were CARBOSE over the first 4-6 h, but SBP (141-128 mmHg; P < 0.001), HR (100-90 b.p.m.; P = 0.002), and RR (24-20 breaths/min; P < 0.001) fell in those who were SOBAR.

The clinical diagnosis of neurovascular events, specifically transient ischemic attack can be challenging, although there is disagreement among vascular trained neurologists regarding this. Currently, there is no single accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia. We studied the relationship between Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels and the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia in the acute phase among patients evaluated in the emergency department following transient focal neurological symptoms. Patients evaluated in our academic center for transient neurological symptoms of possible ischemic mechanism were enrolled with informed consent. Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were performed by DiaDexus, Inc. 100 patients were enrolled: 58 were ischemic (30 stroke, 28 TIA), 10 were unknown, and 28 were non-ischemic. Blood samples were collected after a median delay of 23 h (IQR: 17, 36) after symptom onset. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 activity level for ischemic (stroke and TIA) versus non-ischemic events were 186.5 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 153, 216.3) and 169 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 137, 212.5), respectively. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 mass level for ischemic versus non-ischemic events were 202 ng/ml (IQR = 171.6, 226.1) and 192 ng/ml (167.8, 230). The differences in median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were not statistically significant in the ischemic versus non-ischemic patients. Vessel imaging revealed a symptomatic stenosis in 14 patients (10 intracranial and 4 cervical). The median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels among patients with a symptomatic stenosis were not significantly higher than the levels measured in TIA/stroke patients without stenosis.",

         "Recently, the role of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the pathogenesis of heart failure through different mechanisms has received much attention. Subclinical changes in left ventricular (LV) function can be identified using quantification of myocardial strain, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a superior predictor of outcomes than ejection fraction. We hypothesized that increased OPG levels could predict subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in treated diabetic hypertensive patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. The study was composed of 86 diabetic hypertensive and 30 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. All patients underwent echocardiography and venous blood samples were taken for determination of OPG. The relation between OPG levels and LV GLS was investigated using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Diabetic hypertensive patients had higher diastolic peak early/early diastolic tissue velocity and lower systolic tissue velocity, GLS, GLS rate systolic, and GLS rate early diastolic than nondiabetic hypertensive patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.049, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively). Diabetic hypertensive patients were divided into 2 groups according to median GLS value (> 18.5 and ≤ 18.5). The patients with GLS ≤ 18.5 had higher diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; P = 0.048), OPG (pmol/L; P < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (%; P = 0.042) values than those with GLS > 18.5. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, OPG was found to be an independent predictor of impaired GLS (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that OPG values of > 6.45 (pmol/L) identified the patients with GLS ≤ 18.5.",

Genotyping was performed across 16 000 genes in 893 randomly selected individuals, with replication in 891 subjects from the community. Plasma NT-proANP1-98 concentrations were determined using a radioimmunoassay. Thirty-three genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB locus and were all replicated. To assess the significance, in vitro functional genomic studies and clinical outcomes for carriers of a single-nucleotide polymorphism rs5063 (V32M) located in NPPA that represented the most significant variation in this genetic locus were assessed. The rs5063 variant allozyme in transfected HEK293 cells was decreased to 55±8% of wild-type protein (P=0.01) as assessed by quantitative western blots. Carriers of rs5063 had lower NT-proANP levels (1427 versus 2291 pmol/L; P<0.001) and higher diastolic blood pressures (75 versus 73 mm Hg; P=0.009) and were at an increased risk of stroke when compared with wild-type subjects independent of age, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cholesterol levels (hazard ratio, 1.6; P=0.004).",
