         "George Washington Born in the Colony of Virginia, Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States.",

As the first U.S. president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his cabinet between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Jay Treaty with Britain. Washington set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title \"Mr. President\", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Washington wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of tobacco and wheat at Mount Vernon, Washington owned many slaves. He began opposing slavery near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the manumission of his slaves.",

Washington imported luxury goods from England, paying for them by exporting tobacco. His profligate spending combined with low tobacco prices left him £1,800 in debt by 1764. Washington's complete reliance on London tobacco buyer and merchant Robert Cary also threatened his economic security. Between 1764 and 1766, he sought to diversify his holdings: he changed Mount Vernon's primary cash crop from tobacco to wheat and expanded operations to include flour milling and hemp farming.

He undertook a 34-day, 680-mile (1,090 km) trip in 1784 to check on his land holdings in the Ohio Country. He oversaw the completion of remodeling work at Mount Vernon, which transformed his residence into the mansion that survives to this day—although his financial situation was not strong. Creditors paid him in depreciated wartime currency, and he owed significant amounts in taxes and wages. Mount Vernon had made no profit during his absence, and he saw persistently poor crop yields due to pestilence and bad weather. His estate recorded its eleventh year running at a deficit in 1787.",

The reason for this choice was that Charles had not yet been recognized as ruler of the Kingdom of Naples by a peace treaty, and so the Emperor was considered still de jure King of Naples. Receiving the Hackney from the Holy Roman Empire was common while receiving it from a Bourbon was unusual. The Pope, therefore, considered the first option a less dramatic gesture, and in doing so provoked the wrath of the religious Spanish infante.'",

Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985."

These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, returning to the contingency-based historiography of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that patterns of war allegiance did not fit either Whig or Marxist theories. Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the Glorious Revolution. Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament."

         "William Tecumseh Sherman Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.\""

Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native Americans.

In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans.

When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband.

Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution. Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights. The members of the Progressive Party of 1948 to 1955 saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson. Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man, praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff. In 2016, Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman. Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's first presidency, Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021."

         "Andrew Jackson Since James Madison's presidency when Jackson served as war commander, Jackson deployed a hostile attitude against the Indians, in part by ignoring president's mandates to protect the Indian lands of American settlers Madison, who displayed a paternalistic attitude toward the Indians, then joined with the tribes and commended them for leaving their hunter lives and for beginning to be farmers and farmers.[50] [51] Although there are few details, it is known that he joined with the tribes of the south-east and west, which included the Creeks and the Osage. In contrast, Jackson urged the president to ignore Indian pleas In the eight years of his term, Jackson formulated 70 treaties with the Indians in the south and the northwest.[52] Jackson's presidency marked a new era in American politics and Anglo-Indian relations of displacement of native peoples.[53] Jackson himself participated in the bargaining boards with the Indian tribes, although on other occasions he also delegated this assignment to other people. The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminola and Cherokee The northwestern tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa and the Potawatomi Although conflicts between whites and Indians took place anywhere, the problem had worsened in the south where Indian populations were larger. Clashes often took place with native tribes, especially the Creek and Seminola tribes who refused to follow treaties made by their tribes for various reasons.[54] The Second Seminole War began in December 1835, lasted six years, and finally ended under the presidency of John Tyler in August 1842.[54]"

During this time, any person who submitted a false claim would have to pay double the amount of the government's damages plus $2,000 per false claim. The False Claims Act has been amended several times with a notable amendment being made in 1986 when Congress strengthened the law, and it still remains a model of a successful whistleblower law that works to deter contractors from defrauding the government."

On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself."

         "Atlantic slave trade The life expectancy for Brazil's slave plantation's for African descended slaves was around 23 years. The trans-Atlantic slave trade into Brazil was outlawed in 1831. To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro."

However, Napoleon restored him in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending thousands of troops After suffering the losses of two thirds of the men, many due to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803 Napoleon renounced North America and accepted Louisiana's U.S. Purchase In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it an independent state, the Republic of Haiti, the second republic of the New World."

The country made progress in the social and political spheres and all layers of society benefited from reforms and the sharing of growing prosperity.[269] Brazil's international reputation, both for its political stability and for its investment potential, increased considerably and the empire was considered a modern nation.[268] The economy experienced rapid growth and immigration was expanding. New railway lines, new means of transport were built and other inventions such as telephone and postal mail were extended. \"With slavery destined to disappear and other reforms under way, the prospects for \"moral and material progress\" seemed immense.\"[270]"

Johannesburg, which had until then been a simple village, became the economic center of South Africa The capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, was filled with precious Victorian buildings and a multitude of families enriched with the new economic boom sent their children to study in the Netherlands, resulting in the emergence of a new refined and educated Afrikaner bourgeoisie."

Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985."

These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, returning to the contingency-based historiography of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that patterns of war allegiance did not fit either Whig or Marxist theories. Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the Glorious Revolution. Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament."

         "William Tecumseh Sherman Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.\""

Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native Americans.

He was a strict commander but enjoyed popularity among his troops. They said it was just as strong as walnut wood when it was on the battlefield, so it got the nickname \"Old Hickory\" (Old Walnut) At the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, the 5,000 men of Jackson's troops defeated the 7000 British soldiers At the end of the battle, the English had 2037 war victims: 291 dead (including 3 high-ranking generals), 1262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing The Americans had 71 war victims: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.[24]"

         "Andrew Jackson Jackson arrived in Washington, D.C., on February 11, and began forming his cabinet. He chose Van Buren as Secretary of State, John Eaton as Secretary of War, Samuel D. Ingham as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien as Attorney General, and William T. Barry as Postmaster General. Jackson was inaugurated on March 4, 1829; Adams, who was embittered by his defeat, refused to attend. Jackson was the first president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.  In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans. Jackson invited the public to the White House, which was promptly overrun by well-wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings. The spectacle earned him the nickname \"King Mob\"."

         "Andrew Jackson Jackson immediately offered to raise volunteers for the war, but he was not called to duty until after the United States military was repeatedly defeated in the American Northwest. After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness."

         "Andrew Jackson Jackson's legacy has been variously used by later presidents. Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution. Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights. The members of the Progressive Party of 1948 to 1955 saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson. Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man, praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff. In 2016, Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman. Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's first presidency, Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021."

         "Andrew Jackson Since James Madison's presidency when Jackson served as war commander, Jackson deployed a hostile attitude against the Indians, in part by ignoring president's mandates to protect the Indian lands of American settlers Madison, who displayed a paternalistic attitude toward the Indians, then joined with the tribes and commended them for leaving their hunter lives and for beginning to be farmers and farmers.[50] [51] Although there are few details, it is known that he joined with the tribes of the south-east and west, which included the Creeks and the Osage. In contrast, Jackson urged the president to ignore Indian pleas In the eight years of his term, Jackson formulated 70 treaties with the Indians in the south and the northwest.[52] Jackson's presidency marked a new era in American politics and Anglo-Indian relations of displacement of native peoples.[53] Jackson himself participated in the bargaining boards with the Indian tribes, although on other occasions he also delegated this assignment to other people. The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminola and Cherokee The northwestern tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa and the Potawatomi Although conflicts between whites and Indians took place anywhere, the problem had worsened in the south where Indian populations were larger. Clashes often took place with native tribes, especially the Creek and Seminola tribes who refused to follow treaties made by their tribes for various reasons.[54] The Second Seminole War began in December 1835, lasted six years, and finally ended under the presidency of John Tyler in August 1842.[54]"

         "Presidency of Abraham Lincoln Lincoln also took action against rampant fraud during the civil war, by enacting the False Claims Act in 1863. This law, also known as the \"Lincoln Law,\" made it possible for private citizens to file false claims qui tam lawsuits on behalf of the U.S. government and also protect the US government from contractors providing faulty goods to the Union army. During this time, any person who submitted a false claim would have to pay double the amount of the government's damages plus $2,000 per false claim. The False Claims Act has been amended several times with a notable amendment being made in 1986 when Congress strengthened the law, and it still remains a model of a successful whistleblower law that works to deter contractors from defrauding the government."

Truman In 1950, the Senate, led by Estes Kefauver, investigated numerous charges of corruption among senior administration officials, some of whom had received fur coats and deep freezers in exchange for favors. A large number of employees of the Internal Revenue Bureau (today the IRS) were accepting bribes; 166 employees either resigned or were fired in 1950, with many soon facing indictment. When Attorney General J. Howard McGrath fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath. Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election."

On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself."

To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro."

Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms \"founders\" and \"fathers\" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to \"Founding Fathers\" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985."

These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, returning to the contingency-based historiography of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that patterns of war allegiance did not fit either Whig or Marxist theories. Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the Glorious Revolution. Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament."

         "William Tecumseh Sherman Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.\""

Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native Americans.

Jackson was the first president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.  In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans. Jackson invited the public to the White House, which was promptly overrun by well-wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings. The spectacle earned him the nickname \"King Mob\"."

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband.

Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution. Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights. The members of the Progressive Party of 1948 to 1955 saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson. Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man, praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff. In 2016, Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman. Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's first presidency, Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021."

In contrast, Jackson urged the president to ignore Indian pleas In the eight years of his term, Jackson formulated 70 treaties with the Indians in the south and the northwest.[52] Jackson's presidency marked a new era in American politics and Anglo-Indian relations of displacement of native peoples.[53] Jackson himself participated in the bargaining boards with the Indian tribes, although on other occasions he also delegated this assignment to other people. The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminola and Cherokee The northwestern tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa and the Potawatomi Although conflicts between whites and Indians took place anywhere, the problem had worsened in the south where Indian populations were larger. Clashes often took place with native tribes, especially the Creek and Seminola tribes who refused to follow treaties made by their tribes for various reasons.[54] The Second Seminole War began in December 1835, lasted six years, and finally ended under the presidency of John Tyler in August 1842.[54]"

In 1945, Truman got a new, expensive freezer, and very hard to get. The businessman who always got him gifts was the president of a perfume company and, thanks to the help of Truman and confidante general Harry Vaughan, he was given priority to fly to Europe days after the war, where he bought new perfumes On the way back to the United States, he \"knocked\" on a wounded veteran who was also returning to the country. Release of the episode in 1949 humiliated Truman The President responded strongly by defending Vaughan, an old friend with his own office in the White House Vaughan was time-related to multiple traffic scandals.[177]"

This law, also known as the \"Lincoln Law,\" made it possible for private citizens to file false claims qui tam lawsuits on behalf of the U.S. government and also protect the US government from contractors providing faulty goods to the Union army. During this time, any person who submitted a false claim would have to pay double the amount of the government's damages plus $2,000 per false claim. The False Claims Act has been amended several times with a notable amendment being made in 1986 when Congress strengthened the law, and it still remains a model of a successful whistleblower law that works to deter contractors from defrauding the government."

On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself."

To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro."

         "Pedro II de Brasil The diplomatic victory over the British Empire and the military victory over Uruguay in 1865, together with the happy end of the war with Paraguay in 1870, marked the beginning of what was called the \"golden age\" and heyday of the Brazilian Empire.[268] The 1870s were happy years in Brazil and the Emperor's popularity was at its peak. The country made progress in the social and political spheres and all layers of society benefited from reforms and the sharing of growing prosperity.[269] Brazil's international reputation, both for its political stability and for its investment potential, increased considerably and the empire was considered a modern nation.[268] The economy experienced rapid growth and immigration was expanding. New railway lines, new means of transport were built and other inventions such as telephone and postal mail were extended. \"With slavery destined to disappear and other reforms under way, the prospects for \"moral and material progress\" seemed immense.\"[270]"

         "Pedro II de Brasil In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer dared to say it openly. Peter II was one of those few[271] [272] and considered slavery as a \"national shame.\"[273] Moreover, the emperor had no slaves.[271] In 1823, slaves were 29% of the Brazilian population, but this percentage was 15.2% in 1872.[274] However, the abolition of slavery was a sensitive issue in Brazil. Almost everyone, from the richest to the poorest, had their slaves.[275] [276] However, the emperor wanted to end slavery progressively[242] [277] to mitigate the impact of abolition on the national economy.[278] He pretended to ignore the increasing damage that would cause his image and that of the monarchy his support for abolition.[279]"

         "Afrikáner The decades following the first Boer War were the scene of a great economic, demographic and cultural boom in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, especially after the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand This mountain range, so poetically named,[16] was the scene of a gold rush comparable to that of 1848 in California or 1851 in Victoria, Australia. Johannesburg, which had until then been a simple village, became the economic center of South Africa The capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, was filled with precious Victorian buildings and a multitude of families enriched with the new economic boom sent their children to study in the Netherlands, resulting in the emergence of a new refined and educated Afrikaner bourgeoisie."

Considerable religious agitation ensued Urged by Thomas Cromwell, Parliament passed several laws that sealed the gap with Rome in the spring of 1534 The Law on Restriction of Appeals[17] prohibited appeals by ecclesiastical courts to the pope He also warned the Church to decree any kind of regulation without the prior consent of the king. The Law of Ecclesiastical Appointments[18] of 1534 decreed that clergymen elected to bishops should be nominated by the sovereign The Law of Supremacy,[19] of the same year, declared that “the king is the only supreme head in the land of the Church of England” The Law of Betrayal,[20] also of 1534, made high treason punishable by death to ignore the authority of the king, among other cases The pope was denied all sources of monetary income, such as the Obolo of St. Peter.', 'Pío IX Other actions worthy of note by this pope are the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception (encyclical Ineffabilis Deus of December 8, 1854) and the convening of the First Vatican Council (1869-1870), where papal infallibility was defined for its pronouncements ex cathedra -circumstance this which occurs on very few occasions - and the strengthening of the Roman primacy (the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Aeternus of July 18, 1870). The Council also collected the thesis of Syllabus and by means of the constitution Dei Filius (De fide catholica) recognized to the Papal Romans the primacy of jurisdiction over all bishops, both individually and collectively considered.', 'Charles III of Spain Charles received the strict and structured education of a Spanish Infante by Giovanni Antonio de Medrano; he was very pious and was often in awe of his domineering mother, who according to many contemporaries, he resembled greatly.

In September 2016, Cardinals Raymond Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller and Joachim Meisner wrote a letter to Francis asking him to clarify five claims of Amoris laetitia.[25]', 'Council of Chalcedon According to a letter to the Empress Pulcheria collected among the letters of Leo I, Hilary apologized for not delivering to her the pope\\'s letter after the synod, but owing to Dioscurus, who tried to hinder his going either to Rome or to Constantinople, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. Hilary, who later became pope and dedicated an oratory in the Lateran Basilica in thanks for his life, managed to escape from Constantinople and brought news of the council to Leo who immediately dubbed it a \"synod of robbers\" – Latrocinium – and refused to accept its pronouncements. The decisions of this council now threatened schism between the East and the West.', 'Pope Pius IX Traditionally Catholic Spain offered a challenge to Pius IX as anti-clerical governments came to power in 1832, resulting in the expulsion of religious orders; the closing of convents, Catholic schools and libraries; the seizure and sale of churches and religious properties; and the inability of the church to fill vacant dioceses. In 1851, Pius IX concluded a concordat with Queen Isabella II stipulating that unsold ecclesial properties were to be returned, while the church renounced properties that had already passed to new owners. This flexibility of Pius led to Spain guaranteeing the freedom of the church in religious education.']"

He also describes a conversation with Braddock in which he explicitly warned the General that his plan to march troops to the fort through a narrow valley would be dangerous because of the possibility of an ambush.  This is sometimes cited as advice against the disastrous eventual outcome, but the fact remains that Braddock was not ambushed in that final action, and the battle site was not, in any case, a narrow valley.

The expedition, named after its commander General Edward Braddock, was defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 and forced to retreat; Braddock was killed in action along with more than 500 of his troops. It ultimately proved to be a major setback for the British in the early stages of the war, one of the most disastrous defeats suffered by British forces in the 18th century.\", \"Braddock Expedition Braddock's expedition was part of a massive British offensive against the French in North America that summer. As commander-in-chief of the British Army in America, General Edward Braddock led the main thrust against the Ohio Country with a column some 2,100 strong. His command consisted of two regular line regiments, the 44th and 48th, in all 1,400 regular soldiers and 700 provincial troops from several of the Thirteen Colonies, and artillery and other support troops. With these men, Braddock expected to seize Fort Duquesne easily, and then push on to capture a series of French forts, eventually reaching Fort Niagara. George Washington, promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of the Virginia Regiment on June 4, 1754, by Governor Robert Dinwiddie, was then just 23, knew the territory and served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General Braddock. Braddock's Chief of Scouts was Lieutenant John Fraser of the Virginia Regiment. Fraser owned land at Turtle Creek, had been at Fort Necessity, and had served as Second-in-Command at Fort Prince George (replaced by Fort Duquesne by the French), at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers.\", \"Expedición Braddock The Braddock Expedition or Braddock Campaign was a failed attempt by the British to capture Fort Duquesne during the summer of 1755.

He is remembered for his command of a disastrous expedition against the French-occupied Ohio River Valley in 1755 which led to his death.\", \"Braddock Expedition After an exchange of fire, Gage's advance group fell back. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with the main body of Braddock's force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militiamen and Native Americans enveloped them and began firing from the dense woods on both sides. At this time, the French marines began advancing from the road and blocked any attempt by the British to move forward.\", \"Edward Braddock Braddock's troops reacted poorly and became disordered. The British attempted retreat, but ran into the rest of the British soldiers earlier left behind. Braddock rallied his men repeatedly, but fell at last, mortally wounded by a shot through the chest. Although the exact causes of the defeat are debated to this day, a contributing factor was likely Braddock's underestimation of how effectively the French and Indians could react in a battle situation, and how rapidly the discipline and fighting effectiveness of his own men could evaporate.\"]"

He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne.\", \"Fort Duquesne Fort Duquesne ( dew-KAYN, French: [dykɛːn]; originally called Fort Du Quesne) was a fort established by the French in 1754, at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. It was later taken over by the British, and later the Americans, and developed as Pittsburgh in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Fort Duquesne was destroyed by the French before its British conquest during the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War on the North American front. The British replaced it, building Fort Pitt between 1759 and 1761. The site of both forts is now occupied by Point State Park, where the outlines of the two forts have been laid in granite slabs.\", \"Conquest of New France The three 'prongs' which lasted nearly two months eliminated all French forts and positions. In addition many Canadians deserted or surrendered their arms to British forces while the native allies of the French sought peace and neutrality. By September 6 all three forces had joined up and surrounded Montreal. Lévis tried to negotiate a surrender with 'Honours of War' but Amherst refused to accept this. Lévis however was overruled by Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal the French civilian Governor who persuaded him to surrender to avoid another bloodbath.\", 'Fort Duquesne As the area was within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River, the French had claimed it as theirs. They controlled New France (Quebec), the Illinois Country along the Mississippi, and La Louisiane, the ports of New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama.', \"Fort Duquesne Although Fort Duquesne's location at the forks looked strong on a map—controlling the confluence of three rivers—the reality was rather different.  The site was low, swampy, and prone to flooding.  In addition, the position was dominated by highlands across the Monongahela River, which would allow an enemy to bombard the fort with ease.  Pécaudy de Contrecœur was preparing to abandon the fort in the face of Braddock's advance in 1755. He was able to retain it due to the advancing British force being annihilated (see below).  When the Forbes expedition approached in 1758, the French had initial success in the Battle of Fort Duquesne against the English vanguard, but were forced to abandon the fort in the face of the much superior size of Forbes' main force.\", \"Fort Duquesne The French held the fort successfully early in the war, turning back the expedition led by General Edward Braddock during the 1755 Battle of the Monongahela. George Washington served as one of General Braddock's aides.  A smaller attack by James Grant in September 1758 was repulsed with heavy losses.\", 'Fort Duquesne Two months later, on November 25, 1758, the Forbes Expedition under the Scotsman General John Forbes took possession Fort Duquesne after the French destroyed and abandoned the site.', 'Fort Duquesne Fort Duquesne suffered numerous British assaults and was definitely occupied in 1758, shortly before the seven-year-old war The French officers who defended him decided to destroy the fort, as it was a highly strategic position.', 'Fort Duquesne In 1873, Fort Duquesne is the subject of Old Fort Duquesne, a historical novel by Charles McKnight, which retells the role of Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War.']"

Special bulls were reportedly issued with invitations to Eastern Orthodox and Protestant clerics as well as to other non-Catholics, but apparently none accepted the invitations.', 'Pío IX Other actions worthy of note by this pope are the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception (encyclical Ineffabilis Deus of December 8, 1854) and the convening of the First Vatican Council (1869-1870), where papal infallibility was defined for its pronouncements ex cathedra -circumstance this which occurs on very few occasions - and the strengthening of the Roman primacy (the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Aeternus of July 18, 1870).

In 1745 Pope Benedict XIV explicitly supported the Throne of Mercy depiction, referring to the \"Ancient of Days\", but in 1786 it was still necessary for Pope Pius VI to issue a papal bull condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches, including standard canonical ones.', 'Charles III of Spain The situation worsened when, in 1735, just a few days before the coronation of Charles, the Pope chose to accept the traditional offering of a Hackney horse from the Holy Roman Emperor rather than from Charles.

Virtues and vices may be represented by small figures with particular attributes, or by animals that were thought to embody a particular quality. A common example is the pelican which was thought to peck its breast to feed its young on the blood, thus representing the love of Christ for the Church.', 'Cristianismo en la antigüedad tardía The bishop of Rome receives the title of Pope and his office is that of “paped” As bishopric, its origin is consistent with the development of an episcopal structure in the first century. The papacy, however, also implies the notion of primacy: that the See of Rome is preeminent among all the other Sees, and the Pope primus inter pares The origins of such a concept are historically obscure; theologically, it is based on three ancient Christian traditions: (1) that the apostle Peter was preeminent among the apostles (see Primacy of Simon Peter), (2) that it was Peter who ordained his own successors at the See of Rome, and (3) that the bishops are the successors of the apostles (see apostolic succession). While the Papal See was also the capital of the Western Empire, the prestige of the Bishop of Rome could be taken for granted without the need for sophisticated theological argumentation beyond these points; however, after the capital became Milan and then Ravenna, more detailed arguments based on Matthew 16:18–19, etc. were developed.[37] However, in antiquity, petrine and apostolic quality, as well as a \"primacy of respect\", with regard to the See of Rome were not questioned by emperors, eastern patriarchs and the Eastern Church alike.[38] The Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 affirmed the primacy of Rome.[39] While the pope\\'s appellate jurisdiction and the position of Constantinople would need further doctrinal clarification, by the end of Antiquity the primacy of Rome and the sophisticated theological arguments in its support were fully developed. What exactly implied such primacy, and its exercise, was to become a matter of controversy in certain later times.', \"Arquitectura de las catedrales y las grandes iglesias The symbolism used in ancient churches is not always easy to interpret by today’s people Virtues and vices can be represented by small figures with particular attributes, or by animals believed to embody a particular quality A common example is the pelican thought to be pecking his breast to feed his young with his blood, which represented Christ's love for the Church.\", 'Avignon Papacy This state of affairs culminated in the unbridled declaration of papal supremacy, Unam sanctam, in November 1302.

The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue (though the absence of that threat caused many colonists to conclude they no longer needed British protection). Britain also had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba, but they also gained Louisiana from France, including New Orleans, in compensation for their losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.\", \"Anglo-French War (1627–1629) The Anglo-French War of 1627–1629 (French: Guerre Franco-Anglaise) was a military conflict fought between the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of England between 1627 and 1629. It mainly involved actions at sea. The centrepiece of the conflict was the siege of La Rochelle (1627–28), in which the English Crown supported the French Huguenots in their fight against the French royal forces of Louis XIII of France. La Rochelle had become the stronghold of the French Huguenots, under its own governance. It was the centre of Huguenot seapower and the strongest centre of resistance against the central government. The English also launched a campaign against France's new colony in North America which led to the capture of Quebec.\", \"French and Indian War Two years into the war, in 1756, Great Britain declared war on France, beginning the worldwide Seven Years' War. Many view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of this conflict; however, in the United States the French and Indian War is viewed as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war. French Canadians call it the guerre de la Conquête ('War of the Conquest').\", 'French and Indian War In Europe, the French and Indian War is conflated into the Seven Years\\' War and not given a separate name. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756—two years after the French and Indian War had started—to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. The French and Indian War in America, by contrast, was largely concluded in six years from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.', \"Guerra franco-india The war that took place between 1754 and 1763 received several names In Europe, the set of battles that took place on the continent was known as the Seven Years' War.[9] Since it was officially declared in 1756, and lasted seven years. On the other hand, the American conflict was known by British, British and English-speaking Canadian settlers as a Franco-Indian war. However, French-speaking Canadians called it the Conquest War (in French: Guerre de la Conquête) because the conflict was the British conquest of New France.[10]\", 'Kingdom of Great Britain The Seven Years\\' War, which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale and saw British involvement in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines, and coastal Africa. The results were highly favourable for Britain, and a major disaster for France. Key decisions were largely in the hands of William Pitt the Elder. The war started poorly. Britain lost the island of Minorca in 1756, and suffered a series of defeats in North America. After years of setbacks and mediocre results, British luck turned in the \"miracle year\" (\"Annus Mirabilis\") of 1759. The British had entered the year anxious about a French invasion, but by the end of the year, they were victorious in all theatres. In the Americas, they captured Fort Ticonderoga (Carillon), drove the French out of the Ohio Country, captured Quebec City in Canada as a result of the decisive Battle of the Plains of Abraham, and captured the rich sugar island of Guadeloupe in the West Indies. In India, the John Company repulsed French forces besieging Madras.', \"Guerra franco-india This year officially began the Seven Years' War in Europe, with the Prussian invasion of Austria and Bohemia This brought into play the complicated alliances existing in Europe that had been inherited from the Austrian Succession War, so France and the United Kingdom declared war The outbreak of war in Europe required many of the French troops to stay on the continent and not be able to go to America. However England did not have that problem because its ally Prussia had the best army of land in all of Europe.\", \"American Revolutionary War The French and Indian War, part of the wider global conflict known as the Seven Years' War, ended with the 1763 Peace of Paris, which expelled France from their possessions in New France. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was designed to refocus colonial expansion north into Nova Scotia and south into Florida, with the Mississippi River as the dividing line between British and Spanish possessions in America. Settlement was tightly restricted beyond the 1763 limits, and claims west of this line, including by Virginia and Massachusetts, were rescinded. With the exception of Virginia and others deprived of rights to western lands, the colonial legislatures agreed on the boundaries but disagreed on where to set them. Many settlers resented the restrictions entirely, and enforcement required permanent garrisons along the frontier, which led to increasingly bitter disputes over who should pay for them.\", 'French Wars of Religion Both Kohn (2013) and Clodfelter (2017) followed the same counting and periodisation and noted that \"War of the Three Henrys\" was another name for the Eighth War of Religion, with Kohn adding \"Lovers\\' War\" as another name for the Seventh War. In her Michel de Montaigne biography (2014), Elizabeth Guild concurred with this chronology as well, except for dating the Seventh War of Religion to 1579–1580 rather than just 1580. Holt (2005) asserted a rather different periodisation from 1562 to 1629, writing of \\'civil wars\\' rather than wars of religion, dating the Sixth War to March–September 1577, and dating the Eight War from June 1584 (death of Anjou) to April 1598 (Edict of Nantes); finally, although he didn\\'t put a number on it, Holt regarded the 1610–1629 period as \\'the last war of religion\\'.', 'World War I Before World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War. In August 1914, the magazine The Independent wrote \"This is the Great War. It names itself\". In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean\\'s similarly wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\" Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life. The first recorded use of the term First World War was in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel who stated, \"There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared \\'European War\\' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.\"']"

He owned hundreds of slaves working on his estate known as \"Hermitage Plantation.\" In 1806 he killed a man in a duel on a matter of honor involving his wife Rachel. He came to have national fame through his role in the Anglo-American war of 1812, when he won a major victory against a British invasion of the Battle of New Orleans even though the Treaty of Ghent had already been signed, something unknown to all those involved in the battle.[2] In response to the conflict with the Seminole people in Spanish Florida, he invaded the territory in 1818. This was the direct cause of the first seminal war and the Treaty of Adams-Onís of 1819, which transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.', 'Andrew Jackson Jackson\\'s service in the 1812 war against British forces is known for its success and courage When the British armed forces headed for New Orleans, Jackson took command of the defenses, including militias from several Western states and territories. He was a strict commander but enjoyed popularity among his troops.

He chose Van Buren as Secretary of State, John Eaton as Secretary of War, Samuel D. Ingham as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien as Attorney General, and William T. Barry as Postmaster General. Jackson was inaugurated on March 4, 1829; Adams, who was embittered by his defeat, refused to attend. Jackson was the first president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.  In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans. Jackson invited the public to the White House, which was promptly overrun by well-wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings. The spectacle earned him the nickname \"King Mob\".', \"Andrew Jackson In 1802, he also became major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position that was determined by a vote of the militia's officers.

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness.', \"Andrew Jackson On June 8, Jackson was appointed a brigadier general in the United States Army, and 10 days later was made a brevet major general with command of the Seventh Military District, which included Tennessee, Louisiana, the Mississippi Territory, and the Muscogee Creek Confederacy. With President James Madison's approval, Jackson imposed the Treaty of Fort Jackson. The treaty required all Creek, including those who had remained allies, to surrender 23,000,000 acres (9,300,000 ha) of land to the United States.\", \"Andrew Jackson Jackson's legacy has been variously used by later presidents. Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution. Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights. The members of the Progressive Party of 1948 to 1955 saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson. Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man, praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff. In 2016, Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman. Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's first presidency, Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021.\", \"Andrew Jackson Since James Madison's presidency when Jackson served as war commander, Jackson deployed a hostile attitude against the Indians, in part by ignoring president's mandates to protect the Indian lands of American settlers Madison, who displayed a paternalistic attitude toward the Indians, then joined with the tribes and commended them for leaving their hunter lives and for beginning to be farmers and farmers.[50] [51] Although there are few details, it is known that he joined with the tribes of the south-east and west, which included the Creeks and the Osage. In contrast, Jackson urged the president to ignore Indian pleas In the eight years of his term, Jackson formulated 70 treaties with the Indians in the south and the northwest.[52] Jackson's presidency marked a new era in American politics and Anglo-Indian relations of displacement of native peoples.[53] Jackson himself participated in the bargaining boards with the Indian tribes, although on other occasions he also delegated this assignment to other people. The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminola and Cherokee The northwestern tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa and the Potawatomi Although conflicts between whites and Indians took place anywhere, the problem had worsened in the south where Indian populations were larger. Clashes often took place with native tribes, especially the Creek and Seminola tribes who refused to follow treaties made by their tribes for various reasons.[54] The Second Seminole War began in December 1835, lasted six years, and finally ended under the presidency of John Tyler in August 1842.[54]\"]"

         "['Atlantic slave trade The Spanish and Portuguese colonized South America and enslaved the Indigenous people. They later enslaved Africans brought from West and Central Africa in ships by way of the Atlantic slave trade. Brazil imported 4.8 million enslaved Africans. Africans who escaped slavery there formed quilombos, maroon communities with degrees of self-governance. Palamares, a quilombo community, lasted for 100 years while other communities were quickly removed by the Dutch and Portuguese. The Africans imported to Brazil were Yoruba, Fon, Bantu and others. Their religions from Africa developed into new world religions in Brazil called Candomblé, Umbanda, Xango, and Macumba.', 'French Sudan In 1903, the government instructed French administrators not to use slave as an administrative category anymore and to not help masters recapture runaways.:\\u200a384\\u200a In March 1905, a slave exodus began in Banamba that preceded by six months a formal French decree ending slavery throughout French West Africa.:\\u200a376\\u200a With legal protection, almost a million slaves followed this example by moving away from their masters and settling elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.', 'Pedro II of Brazil During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper, and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women\\'s rights. On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.', \"Atlantic slave trade The life expectancy for Brazil's slave plantation's for African descended slaves was around 23 years. The trans-Atlantic slave trade into Brazil was outlawed in 1831. To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro.\", \"Declaración de los Derechos del Hombre y del Ciudadano The deplorable conditions for the thousands of slaves in Saint-Domingue, the world's most profitable slave colony, led to uprisings that would be known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World Colorless people were part of the first wave of revolts, but then the former slaves took control In 1794, the Jacobin-dominated Convention abolished slavery, even in the colonies of Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe. However, Napoleon restored him in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending thousands of troops After suffering the losses of two thirds of the men, many due to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803 Napoleon renounced North America and accepted Louisiana's U.S. Purchase In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it an independent state, the Republic of Haiti, the second republic of the New World.\", 'Pedro II de Brasil His mortal remains, as well as those of his wife, were finally taken to Brazil in 1921, in time for the centenary of Brazilian independence in 1922, as the government wanted to give Peter II honors as head of state.[428] [429] The national holiday was declared and the return of the emperor as national hero was celebrated throughout the country.[424] Thousands of people participated in the main ceremony in Rio de Janeiro Historian Pedro Calmon described the scene: «The old ones wept Many were kneeling They all applauded. There were no differences between Republicans and monarchists They were all Brazilians.\"[430] This tribute marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.[429]', 'Pedro II de Brasil The diplomatic victory over the British Empire and the military victory over Uruguay in 1865, together with the happy end of the war with Paraguay in 1870, marked the beginning of what was called the \"golden age\" and heyday of the Brazilian Empire.[268] The 1870s were happy years in Brazil and the Emperor\\'s popularity was at its peak. The country made progress in the social and political spheres and all layers of society benefited from reforms and the sharing of growing prosperity.[269] Brazil\\'s international reputation, both for its political stability and for its investment potential, increased considerably and the empire was considered a modern nation.[268] The economy experienced rapid growth and immigration was expanding. New railway lines, new means of transport were built and other inventions such as telephone and postal mail were extended. \"With slavery destined to disappear and other reforms under way, the prospects for \"moral and material progress\" seemed immense.\"[270]', 'Pedro II de Brasil In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer dared to say it openly. Peter II was one of those few[271] [272] and considered slavery as a \"national shame.\"[273] Moreover, the emperor had no slaves.[271] In 1823, slaves were 29% of the Brazilian population, but this percentage was 15.2% in 1872.[274] However, the abolition of slavery was a sensitive issue in Brazil. Almost everyone, from the richest to the poorest, had their slaves.[275] [276] However, the emperor wanted to end slavery progressively[242] [277] to mitigate the impact of abolition on the national economy.[278] He pretended to ignore the increasing damage that would cause his image and that of the monarchy his support for abolition.[279]', 'Afrikáner The decades following the first Boer War were the scene of a great economic, demographic and cultural boom in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, especially after the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand This mountain range, so poetically named,[16] was the scene of a gold rush comparable to that of 1848 in California or 1851 in Victoria, Australia. Johannesburg, which had until then been a simple village, became the economic center of South Africa The capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, was filled with precious Victorian buildings and a multitude of families enriched with the new economic boom sent their children to study in the Netherlands, resulting in the emergence of a new refined and educated Afrikaner bourgeoisie.', 'Colonia del Cabo Mabin, Alan (1983) Recession and its aftermath: The Cape Colony in the Eighteen Eighties University of the Witwatersrand, African Studies Institute.']"

         "William Tecumseh Sherman Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.\"",

         "Andrew Jackson By January 1814, the expiration of enlistments and desertion had reduced Jackson's force by about 1,000 volunteers, but he continued the offensive. The Red Sticks counterattacked at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. Jackson repelled them but was forced to withdraw to Fort Strother. Jackson's army was reinforced by further recruitment and the addition of a regular army unit, the 39th U.S. Infantry Regiment. The combined force of 3,000 men—including Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek allies—attacked a Red Stick fort at Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River, which was manned by about 1,000 men. The Red Sticks were overwhelmed and massacred. Almost all their warriors were killed, and nearly 300 women and children were taken prisoner and distributed to Jackson's Native American allies. The victory broke the power of the Red Sticks. Jackson continued his scorched-earth campaign of burning villages, destroying supplies, and starving Red Stick women and children. The campaign ended when William Weatherford, the Red Stick leader, surrendered, although some Red Sticks fled to East Florida.",

Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial.

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers, who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack. When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed, and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband. Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness.",

Johannesburg, which had until then been a simple village, became the economic center of South Africa The capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, was filled with precious Victorian buildings and a multitude of families enriched with the new economic boom sent their children to study in the Netherlands, resulting in the emergence of a new refined and educated Afrikaner bourgeoisie.",

         "Atlantic slave trade The life expectancy for Brazil's slave plantation's for African descended slaves was around 23 years. The trans-Atlantic slave trade into Brazil was outlawed in 1831. To replace the demand for slaves, slaveholders in Brazil turned to slave reproduction. Enslaved women were forced to give birth to eight or more enslaved children. Some slaveholders promised enslaved women their freedom if they gave birth to eight children. In 1873 in the village of Santa Ana, province of Ceará an enslaved woman named Macária was promised her freedom after she gave birth to eight children. An enslaved woman Delfina killed her baby because she did not want her enslaver Manoel Bento da Costa to own her baby and enslave her child. Brazil practiced partus sequitur ventrem to increase the slave population through enslaved female reproduction, because in the 19th century, Brazil needed a large enslaved labor force to work on the sugar plantations in Bahia and the agricultural and mining industries of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro.",

On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.",

Almost everyone, from the richest to the poorest, had their slaves.[275] [276] However, the emperor wanted to end slavery progressively[242] [277] to mitigate the impact of abolition on the national economy.[278] He pretended to ignore the increasing damage that would cause his image and that of the monarchy his support for abolition.[279]",

The country made progress in the social and political spheres and all layers of society benefited from reforms and the sharing of growing prosperity.[269] Brazil's international reputation, both for its political stability and for its investment potential, increased considerably and the empire was considered a modern nation.[268] The economy experienced rapid growth and immigration was expanding.
