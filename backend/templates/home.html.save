<p>Our application is designed to detect knowledge gaps and discrepancies across language-specific versions of Wikipedia. By highlighting differences that may stem from cultural perspectives or biases, it helps reveal where factual accuracy and cultural interpretation blur together.</p>

<p>With a modular and portable design, the tool can be deployed locally and integrated into existing workflows. Its main goal is to support fact-checkers, researchers, and QA systems by sanitizing text databases, improving transparency, and ensuring more reliable information sources.</p>

<p>Use the command block to inspect contradictions and start exploring how the application can streamline the detection of inconsistencies in knowledge bases.</p>
