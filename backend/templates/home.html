<h1>Welcome to MIND!</h1>
<p>Our application is designed to detect knowledge gaps and discrepancies
    across language-specific versions of Wikipedia.
    By highlighting differences that may stem from cultural perspectives or biases,
    it helps reveal where factual accuracy and cultural interpretation blur together.</p>

<p>With a modular and portable design, 
    the tool can be deployed locally and integrated into existing workflows. Its main goal is to support fact-checkers, researchers, and QA systems by sanitizing text databases, improving transparency, and ensuring more reliable information sources.</p>

<p>Please log in to inspect contradictions and start exploring!<p>
